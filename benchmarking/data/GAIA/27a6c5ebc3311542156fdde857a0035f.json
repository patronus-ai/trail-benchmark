At this point, I am able to discern that \"A G U L L\" is probably meant to be \"A GULL\". However, I continue to read through the rest of the lines to get a sense of any other words that might jump out that would substantiate \"A GULL\" being accurate both semantically and syntactically. 2. So now I am on the last line and decide to work backwards. \"CHAIR\" is on the last line all by itself and this does seem a plausible fit as a full word rather than a fragment of another word. When I look to the line directly above \"Y T O M Y\", the word \"my\" jumps out and this is a natural accompaniment to the noun often used to indicate possession. \n3. Eliminating the \"MY\" at the end of \"Y T O MY\" leaves \"Y T O\" remaining in the line and I immediately recognize the preposition \"TO\". It is a this point I am fairly confident that \"TO MY CHAIR\" is most likely accurate. Given that there is only a \"Y\" left, I discern it is more than likely the end of a word located in the row above.\n4. I am now on the fifth row down and am looking at the letters \"E F U L L\" Attaching the \"Y\" left over from the sixth row below I see \"E F U L L Y\"  I recognize the word \"FULLY\" I know it can stand alone as an adverb or it can serve as a suffix to a larger adverb.\n5. Detaching the \"FULLY\", leaves the \"E\" alone on the line. Knowing it does not represent a word on its own in the English language, I look to attach it to the line above (row 4).\n6. The fourth row reads \"D P E A C\". Adding the \"E\" to the end, the first word I can separate out is \"ACE\". However \"ACEFULLY\" is not a word nor does \"ACE FULLY TO MY CHAIR\" make sense. When working my way left through the line, continuing to attach each letter as I go, I land on the \"P\" and am fairly confident that the word is \"PEACEFULLY\".\n7. Eliminating the \"PEAC\" from the row leaves me left with a \"D\". Now I look at the row above, row 3 and see that the row comprises the word \"GLIDE\" Adding the \"D\" to the end of the word would not only be permissible in terms of a displaying appropriate tense but it also makes sense as I add it to the fragment I have so far. I now can read \"GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".\n8. Now, I am on the second line and if I were to read it from there on down it would read \"A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".  While this reads well and makes sense semantically and syntactically on its own, it does not make sense when I add the first row. THESE A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR.  So now I am left with the conclusion that  \"A GULL\" is not correct. Either it is part of a larger word or the letters need to be broken down further. At a quick glace, I can see that they don't make sense being broken down further so I leave \"GULL\" and add the \"A\" to the string above. Immediately my eye sees that \"A can be added to \"SE\" to make \"SEA\" and that the remaining\nletters spell the word \"THE\"  I now know the sentence reads \"The seagull glided peacefully to my chair.",

                                            "Steps": "1. I start with the first line, \"T H E S E\" and proceed to the next, \"A G U L L\". At this point, I am able to discern that \"A G U L L\" is probably meant to be \"A GULL\". However, I continue to read through the rest of the lines to get a sense of any other words that might jump out that would substantiate \"A GULL\" being accurate both semantically and syntactically. 2. So now I am on the last line and decide to work backwards. \"CHAIR\" is on the last line all by itself and this does seem a plausible fit as a full word rather than a fragment of another word. When I look to the line directly above \"Y T O M Y\", the word \"my\" jumps out and this is a natural accompaniment to the noun often used to indicate possession. \n3. Eliminating the \"MY\" at the end of \"Y T O MY\" leaves \"Y T O\" remaining in the line and I immediately recognize the preposition \"TO\". It is a this point I am fairly confident that \"TO MY CHAIR\" is most likely accurate. Given that there is only a \"Y\" left, I discern it is more than likely the end of a word located in the row above.\n4. I am now on the fifth row down and am looking at the letters \"E F U L L\" Attaching the \"Y\" left over from the sixth row below I see \"E F U L L Y\"  I recognize the word \"FULLY\" I know it can stand alone as an adverb or it can serve as a suffix to a larger adverb.\n5. Detaching the \"FULLY\", leaves the \"E\" alone on the line. Knowing it does not represent a word on its own in the English language, I look to attach it to the line above (row 4).\n6. The fourth row reads \"D P E A C\". Adding the \"E\" to the end, the first word I can separate out is \"ACE\". However \"ACEFULLY\" is not a word nor does \"ACE FULLY TO MY CHAIR\" make sense. When working my way left through the line, continuing to attach each letter as I go, I land on the \"P\" and am fairly confident that the word is \"PEACEFULLY\".\n7. Eliminating the \"PEAC\" from the row leaves me left with a \"D\". Now I look at the row above, row 3 and see that the row comprises the word \"GLIDE\" Adding the \"D\" to the end of the word would not only be permissible in terms of a displaying appropriate tense but it also makes sense as I add it to the fragment I have so far. I now can read \"GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".\n8. Now, I am on the second line and if I were to read it from there on down it would read \"A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".  While this reads well and makes sense semantically and syntactically on its own, it does not make sense when I add the first row. THESE A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR.  So now I am left with the conclusion that  \"A GULL\" is not correct. Either it is part of a larger word or the letters need to be broken down further. At a quick glace, I can see that they don't make sense being broken down further so I leave \"GULL\" and add the \"A\" to the string above. Immediately my eye sees that \"A can be added to \"SE\" to make \"SEA\" and that the remaining\nletters spell the word \"THE\"  I now know the sentence reads \"The seagull glided peacefully to my chair.",

Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task includes a 5\u00d77 block of letters arranged in 7 rows of 5 letters each:  \n\u2003\u2003Row 1: THESE  \n\u2003\u2003Row 2: AGULL  \n\u2003\u2003Row 3: GLIDE  \n\u2003\u2003Row 4: DPEAC  \n\u2003\u2003Row 5: EFULL  \n\u2003\u2003Row 6: YTOMY  \n\u2003\u2003Row 7: CHAIR  \n\u2022 The letters must be read from left to right in order, using all of them to form a complete sentence.  \n\u2022 The task emphasizes that a correct answer is required and that all available tools should be used, along with any necessary verification steps to ensure correctness.  \n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 No external facts such as dates, names, or external data seem necessary; every detail needed appears contained within the task itself.  \n\u2022 Any verification step involves re-checking the order of letters and ensuring that the derived sentence makes sense, but the sources for these are solely the given text block.  \n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The complete hidden sentence must be constructed by concatenating the letters of the block in order:  \n\u2003\u2003\"THESEAGULLGLIDEDPEACEFULLYTOMYCHAIR\"  \n\u2022 By evaluating the string and inserting appropriate spaces, we derive the sentence:  \n\u2003\u2003\"THE SEAGULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\"  \n\u2022 The derivation involves noticing that the initial five letters \"THESE\" can be split as \"THE\" and \"SE\", then recognizing familiar word boundaries in the concatenated string to correctly reassemble the intended sentence.\n```\n\nNow begin!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search!
