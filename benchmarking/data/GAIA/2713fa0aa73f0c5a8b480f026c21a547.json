Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The final answer must be based on information \u201cAccording to wikipedia.\u201d  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The answer is explicitly sourced from Wikipedia data as of 2021.  \n\u2022 The scope is Asian countries with a monarchy.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Only those countries in Asia that still have some form of monarchy are considered.  \n\u2022 The countries must have access to the sea.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The answer requires filtering Asian monarchies by whether they have a seacoast rather than being landlocked.  \n\u2022 The time reference is 2021.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The data needs to reflect the status of countries as it was in the year 2021.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Current list of Asian countries with a monarchy as recorded in Wikipedia.  \n\u2002 Where to look: Wikipedia articles such as \u201cList of current monarchies\u201d or region-specific pages like \u201cMonarchies in Asia.\u201d  \n\u2002 Reasoning: We need an accurate and comprehensive list of Asian monarchies as of 2021.  \n\u2022 Verification of which of those Asian monarchies have access to the sea.  \n\u2002 Where to look: Wikipedia pages related to each country's geography (for example, \u201cGeography of [Country Name]\u201d), or the country\u2019s article on Wikipedia, which shows if it has a seacoast.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: To narrow down the list, each country's maritime boundaries have to be confirmed.  \n\u2022 The definition and scope of what \u201caccess to the sea\u201d means as per the relevant Wikipedia sources.  \n\u2002 Where to look: Wikipedia guidelines or relevant articles on \u201cmaritime boundaries\u201d or \u201clandlocked country.\u201d  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Clarification is needed to decide whether a narrow coastal outlet (such as a strip of coastline) qualifies as access to the sea.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that the data from Wikipedia reflects the situation as of 2021.  \n\u2002 Where to look: Check the \u201cas of\u201d dates in the articles or viewing the history of relevant pages on Wikipedia.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task specifies the status in 2021, so the information needs to be verified for that specific year.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The filtered list of Asian countries that are both monarchies and have access to the sea, based on the information retrieved.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: From the fully gathered data, we need to create a set intersection: Asian monarchies \u2229 countries with maritime access.  \n\u2022 The final count (number) of such countries.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the list is compiled, the final step is to count the number of countries meeting both criteria.  \n\u2022 Logical verification steps to ensure that the counting is consistent with Wikipedia\u2019s data as of 2021.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: It is important to double-check the results based on the authoritative source to ensure correctness.\n```\n\nNow begin!
