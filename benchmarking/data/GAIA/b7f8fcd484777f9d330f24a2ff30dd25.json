When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",

Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded.\nRun verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer!\nHere is the task:\nIn the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.\n```\nYou can leverage these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The sentence must follow the Tizin word order: Verb first, then direct object, then subject.  \n\u2022 The task is to translate \u201cI like apples\u201d into Tizin.  \n\u2022 The verb \u201cto like\u201d (expressing an intense like) is given as \u201cMaktay\u201d in the present (root) form.  \n\u2022 The word for apples is borrowed from English. Its forms are: \u201cApple\u201d (nominative), \u201cZapple\u201d (accusative), and \u201cIzapple\u201d (genitive).  \n\u2022 The word for oneself is given as \u201cPa\u201d in the nominative form, \u201cMato\u201d in the accusative, and \u201cSing\u201d in the genitive.  \n\u2022 The Tizin language treats the thing doing the liking as the object of the sentence (the direct object comes before the subject).\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 No additional external facts need to be looked up because all specific vocabulary, forms, and word order rules required to complete the translation are provided in the task.  \n\u2022 (If needed, one might verify the definitions of \u201cnominative,\u201d \u201caccusative,\u201d and \u201cgenitive\u201d forms from a grammar reference, but the task gives the essential forms for Tizin.)\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The correct verb form for \u201cto like\u201d in present tense is \u201cMaktay.\u201d  \n\u2022 Given that the sentence in Tizin must follow Verb\u2013Direct Object\u2013Subject order, and knowing that \u201capples\u201d (as the object) should be in its accusative form \u201cZapple,\u201d we derive that the direct object is \u201cZapple.\u201d  \n\u2022 The subject \u201cI\u201d is expressed in the nominative form \u201cPa,\u201d and because in Tizin the one doing the liking appears after the object, we conclude that the subject element is \u201cPa\u201d at the end.  \n\u2022 Thus, by applying the word order and appropriate case endings, the translation of \u201cI like apples\u201d in Tizin is derived as: Maktay Zapple Pa.\n```\n\nNow begin!

Identify the relevant vocabulary in Tizin: the present tense verb \"Maktay\" for \"to like\" (expressing intense liking), the accusative form for apples (\"Zapple\"), and the nominative form for oneself (\"Pa\").\n3. Determine the correct word order based on Tizin grammar: place the verb first, followed by the direct object, and then the subject.\n4.

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The sentence must follow the Tizin word order: Verb first, then direct object, then subject.  \\n\u2022 The task is to translate \u201cI like apples\u201d into Tizin.  \\n\u2022 The verb \u201cto like\u201d (expressing an intense like) is given as \u201cMaktay\u201d in the present (root) form.  \\n\u2022 The word for apples is borrowed from English. Its forms are: \u201cApple\u201d (nominative), \u201cZapple\u201d (accusative), and \u201cIzapple\u201d (genitive).  \\n\u2022 The word for oneself is given as \u201cPa\u201d in the nominative form, \u201cMato\u201d in the accusative, and \u201cSing\u201d in the genitive.  \\n\u2022 The Tizin language treats the thing doing the liking as the object of the sentence (the direct object comes before the subject).\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 No additional external facts need to be looked up because all specific vocabulary, forms, and word order rules required to complete the translation are provided in the task.  \\n\u2022 (If needed, one might verify the definitions of \u201cnominative,\u201d \u201caccusative,\u201d and \u201cgenitive\u201d forms from a grammar reference, but the task gives the essential forms for Tizin.)\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The correct verb form for \u201cto like\u201d in present tense is \u201cMaktay.\u201d  \\n\u2022 Given that the sentence in Tizin must follow Verb\u2013Direct Object\u2013Subject order, and knowing that \u201capples\u201d (as the object) should be in its accusative form \u201cZapple,\u201d we derive that the direct object is \u201cZapple.\u201d  \\n\u2022 The subject \u201cI\u201d is expressed in the nominative form \u201cPa,\u201d and because in Tizin the one doing the liking appears after the object, we conclude that the subject element is \u201cPa\u201d at the end.  \\n\u2022 Thus, by applying the word order and appropriate case endings, the translation of \u201cI like apples\u201d in Tizin is derived as: Maktay Zapple Pa.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_2', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'python_interpreter', 'arguments': 'final_answer(\\\"Maktay Zapple Pa\\\")'}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_2\\nObservation:\\nExecution logs:\\nLast output from code snippet:\\nMaktay Zapple Pa\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\\nRead the above conversation and output a FINAL ANSWER to the question.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The sentence must follow the Tizin word order: Verb first, then direct object, then subject.  \n\u2022 The task is to translate \u201cI like apples\u201d into Tizin.  \n\u2022 The verb \u201cto like\u201d (expressing an intense like) is given as \u201cMaktay\u201d in the present (root) form.  \n\u2022 The word for apples is borrowed from English. Its forms are: \u201cApple\u201d (nominative), \u201cZapple\u201d (accusative), and \u201cIzapple\u201d (genitive).  \n\u2022 The word for oneself is given as \u201cPa\u201d in the nominative form, \u201cMato\u201d in the accusative, and \u201cSing\u201d in the genitive.  \n\u2022 The Tizin language treats the thing doing the liking as the object of the sentence (the direct object comes before the subject).\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 No additional external facts need to be looked up because all specific vocabulary, forms, and word order rules required to complete the translation are provided in the task.  \n\u2022 (If needed, one might verify the definitions of \u201cnominative,\u201d \u201caccusative,\u201d and \u201cgenitive\u201d forms from a grammar reference, but the task gives the essential forms for Tizin.)\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The correct verb form for \u201cto like\u201d in present tense is \u201cMaktay.\u201d  \n\u2022 Given that the sentence in Tizin must follow Verb\u2013Direct Object\u2013Subject order, and knowing that \u201capples\u201d (as the object) should be in its accusative form \u201cZapple,\u201d we derive that the direct object is \u201cZapple.\u201d  \n\u2022 The subject \u201cI\u201d is expressed in the nominative form \u201cPa,\u201d and because in Tizin the one doing the liking appears after the object, we conclude that the subject element is \u201cPa\u201d at the end.  \n\u2022 Thus, by applying the word order and appropriate case endings, the translation of \u201cI like apples\u201d in Tizin is derived as: Maktay Zapple Pa.\n```",
