Calculated the number of bottles (3,200 / 100 = 32, 32 * 5 = 160 bottles).\n13. Multiplied bottles by bottle deposit (160 * 5 = 800).\n14. Converted cents to dollars ($8).",

I always recycle my water bottles at the end of a trip, and I drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles I travel, rounded to the nearest 100. Assuming I follow I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, then take I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta, how many dollars will I get back according to Wikipedia?\n```\nYou can leverage these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 It is May 2023.  \n\u2022 The trip is a drive across the U.S. from California to Maine.  \n\u2022 The route is specified as follows: take I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, then I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta.  \n\u2022 The water consumption habit is: 5 twelve\u2010ounce water bottles are consumed for every 100 miles traveled.  \n\u2022 The 100-mile quantity is determined by \u201crounded to the nearest 100.\u201d  \n\u2022 At the end of the trip the used water bottles are all recycled, and recycling them produces a dollar refund\u2014as noted \u201caccording to Wikipedia.\u201d\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The exact traveled distance on I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati.  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: Online mapping tools, official highway mileage listings, or relevant Wikipedia articles on I\u201140.  \n\u2022 The exact traveled distance on I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta.  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: Similar mapping tools, official highway mileage listings, or Wikipedia articles on I\u201190.  \n\u2022 The official container deposit (refund value) for a 12\u2011ounce water bottle as given on Wikipedia.  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: The Wikipedia article on \u201cContainer deposit legislation\u201d or \u201cBottle bill\u201d, or related government sources cited by that article.  \n\u2022 Confirmation of the rounding instruction \u2013 that the total miles traveled (or the segment distances) are rounded to the nearest 100 miles to determine the number of water bottles.  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: The text of the task itself (to ensure no misinterpretation).\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The total distance traveled by summing the mileage from Los Angeles to Cincinnati (via I\u201140) and from Cincinnati to Augusta (via I\u201190).  \n\u2003\u2013 Logical derivation: Total Distance = Distance (I\u201140 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati) + Distance (I\u201190 from Cincinnati to Augusta).  \n\u2022 The rounded total mileage, following the \u201crounded to the nearest 100\u201d rule.  \n\u2003\u2013 Logical step: Round the total distance calculated above to the nearest 100 miles.  \n\u2022 The total number of water bottles consumed, using the rate of 5 bottles per 100 miles of (rounded) travel.  \n\u2003\u2013 Logical step: Number of Bottles = (Rounded Total Distance / 100) \u00d7 5.  \n\u2022 The total dollar refund received from recycling the water bottles, by multiplying the total number of bottles by the deposit refund per bottle (as determined by the Wikipedia lookup).  \n\u2003\u2013 Logical step: Dollar Refund = (Number of Bottles) \u00d7 (Deposit Refund per Bottle).\n\n\n```\n\nNow begin!

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['xml', 'zipfile', 'numpy', 'bs4', 'time', 'pubchempy', 'yahoo_finance', 'datetime', 'collections', 're', 'os', 'sympy', 'pptx', 'pydub', 'random', 'io', 'unicodedata', 'scipy', 'queue', 'requests', 'chess', 'csv', 'statistics', 'torch', 'json', 'math', 'PyPDF2', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'PIL', 'itertools', 'Bio', 'stat', 'sklearn']\\n9.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['xml', 'zipfile', 'numpy', 'bs4', 'time', 'pubchempy', 'yahoo_finance', 'datetime', 'collections', 're', 'os', 'sympy', 'pptx', 'pydub', 'random', 'io', 'unicodedata', 'scipy', 'queue', 'requests', 'chess', 'csv', 'statistics', 'torch', 'json', 'math', 'PyPDF2', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'PIL', 'itertools', 'Bio', 'stat', 'sklearn']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",
