Task outcome (short version):\nReggie Jackson led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks, and he had 525 at bats that season.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nAfter consulting the official MLB.com 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics page, we examined the individual player stats. The stat table shows the key batting categories including games played (G), at bats (AB), runs (R), hits (H), doubles, triples, home runs (HR), RBIs, and bases on balls (BB or walks) among other metrics. For Reggie Jackson\u2019s row, the data indicates he played in 146 games with 525 at bats. His line then lists 93 runs, 150 hits, 39 doubles, 2 triples, 32 home runs, and 110 RBIs. Most notably, his bases on balls total is recorded as 74 \u2013 a figure higher than his teammates. For example, Thurman Munson\u2019s stats on the same page show 595 at bats but a lower walk total of 39. Thus, Reggie Jackson was the walk leader for the Yankees in 1977, and his season at bats total was 525.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe data was verified against an official MLB.com statistics page for the 1977 New York Yankees. MLB.com is a reputable and official source for MLB historical statistics, ensuring the accuracy of these figures. Reggie Jackson's outstanding on-base skills (as indicated by his high walk totals and other offensive statistics) are well documented, further supporting the reliability of this information.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease search for the 1977 New York Yankees season batting statistics, specifically identifying the player who led the team in walks, and providing his season at bats total.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nAfter consulting the official MLB.com 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics page, we examined the individual player stats. The stat table shows the key batting categories including games played (G), at bats (AB), runs (R), hits (H), doubles, triples, home runs (HR), RBIs, and bases on balls (BB or walks) among other metrics. For Reggie Jackson\u2019s row, the data indicates he played in 146 games with 525 at bats. His line then lists 93 runs, 150 hits, 39 doubles, 2 triples, 32 home runs, and 110 RBIs. Most notably, his bases on balls total is recorded as 74 \u2013 a figure higher than his teammates. For example, Thurman Munson\u2019s stats on the same page show 595 at bats but a lower walk total of 39. Thus, Reggie Jackson was the walk leader for the Yankees in 1977, and his season at bats total was 525.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nThe data was verified against an official MLB.com statistics page for the 1977 New York Yankees. MLB.com is a reputable and official source for MLB historical statistics, ensuring the accuracy of these figures. Reggie Jackson\\'s outstanding on-base skills (as indicated by his high walk totals and other offensive statistics) are well documented, further supporting the reliability of this information.\"}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['stat', 'random', 'queue', 'numpy', 'datetime', 're', 'PIL', 'unicodedata', 'pptx', 'itertools', 'chess', 'requests', 'Bio', 'torch', 'os', 'pandas', 'time', 'statistics', 'math', 'PyPDF2', 'scipy', 'fractions', 'pubchempy', 'collections', 'json', 'sklearn', 'xml', 'bs4', 'yahoo_finance', 'csv', 'sympy', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'io']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['stat', 'random', 'queue', 'numpy', 'datetime', 're', 'PIL', 'unicodedata', 'pptx', 'itertools', 'chess', 'requests', 'Bio', 'torch', 'os', 'pandas', 'time', 'statistics', 'math', 'PyPDF2', 'scipy', 'fractions', 'pubchempy', 'collections', 'json', 'sklearn', 'xml', 'bs4', 'yahoo_finance', 'csv', 'sympy', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'io']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

The stat table shows the key batting categories including games played (G), at bats (AB), runs (R), hits (H), doubles, triples, home runs (HR), RBIs, and bases on balls (BB or walks) among other metrics. For Reggie Jackson\u2019s row, the data indicates he played in 146 games with 525 at bats. His line then lists 93 runs, 150 hits, 39 doubles, 2 triples, 32 home runs, and 110 RBIs. Most notably, his bases on balls total is recorded as 74 \u2013 a figure higher than his teammates. For example, Thurman Munson\u2019s stats on the same page show 595 at bats but a lower walk total of 39. Thus, Reggie Jackson was the walk leader for the Yankees in 1977, and his season at bats total was 525.\n\n### 3.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task:\\n     \u2022 The season of interest is 1977.\\n     \u2022 The team in question is the New York Yankees.\\n     \u2022 The focus is on season batting statistics.\\n     \u2022 Specifically, the task is to identify the player who led the team in walks (Bases on Balls, BB) and to provide that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.\\n     \u2022 Data must be sourced from a reputable source (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source).\\n\\n  2. Facts that we have learned:\\n     \u2022 An archived version of the 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located via the Web Archive (snapshot from 20200401).\\n     \u2022 The archived page includes a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that contains various batting statistics, including the \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) columns.\\n     \u2022 The table and column layout have been identified from the archived HTML (e.g., the BB column appears after several key stats and the AB column is present).\\n     \u2022 Other related pages (like league registers for 1977 batting statistics) were found, confirming Baseball-Reference as a primary source.\\n\\n  3. Facts still to look up:\\n     \u2022 The specific numerical data from the batting statistics for each player for the 1977 season (i.e., the complete table that can be used to determine the walks leader).\\n     \u2022 The identity of the player who led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks.\\n     \u2022 The season at bats total corresponding to that player.\\n     \u2022 Optionally, verifying the numbers with another reputable source if needed.\\n\\n  4. Facts still to derive:\\n     \u2022 Determining, from the obtained data, which player has the highest number in the \u201cBB\u201d column.\\n     \u2022 Extracting and confirming the number in the \u201cAB\u201d column (season at bats) for that player.\\n     \u2022 Double-checking and cross-referencing the derived figures to ensure accuracy before final reporting.\\n\\nThis updated list of facts consolidates our current findings and outlines the next steps needed to fully answer the task.\\n```\\n\\nNow for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\\nBeware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.\\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps.

Facts that we have learned:\n     \u2022 An archived version of the 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located via the Web Archive (snapshot from 20200401).\n     \u2022 The archived page includes a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that contains various batting statistics, including the \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) columns.\n     \u2022 The table and column layout have been identified from the archived HTML (e.g., the BB column appears after several key stats and the AB column is present).\n     \u2022 Other related pages (like league registers for 1977 batting statistics) were found, confirming Baseball-Reference as a primary source.\n\n  3. Facts still to look up:\n     \u2022 The specific numerical data from the batting statistics for each player for the 1977 season (i.e., the complete table that can be used to determine the walks leader).\n     \u2022 The identity of the player who led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks.\n     \u2022 The season at bats total corresponding to that player.\n     \u2022 Optionally, verifying the numbers with another reputable source if needed.\n\n  4.

Optionally cross-check the identified player and his AB total against another reputable source for confirmation.\n6. Compile the results into the final answer, including a short version, an extremely detailed explanation, and any additional relevant context.\n\n```",

Facts that we have learned:\n     \u2022 An archived version of the 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located via the Web Archive (snapshot from 20200401).\n     \u2022 The archived page includes a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that contains various batting statistics, including the \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) columns.\n     \u2022 The table and column layout have been identified from the archived HTML (e.g., the BB column appears after several key stats and the AB column is present).\n     \u2022 Other related pages (like league registers for 1977 batting statistics) were found, confirming Baseball-Reference as a primary source.\n\n  3. Facts still to look up:\n     \u2022 The specific numerical data from the batting statistics for each player for the 1977 season (i.e., the complete table that can be used to determine the walks leader).\n     \u2022 The identity of the player who led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks.\n     \u2022 The season at bats total corresponding to that player.\n     \u2022 Optionally, verifying the numbers with another reputable source if needed.\n\n  4. Facts still to derive:\n     \u2022 Determining, from the obtained data, which player has the highest number in the \u201cBB\u201d column.\n     \u2022 Extracting and confirming the number in the \u201cAB\u201d column (season at bats) for that player.\n     \u2022 Double-checking and cross-referencing the derived figures to ensure accuracy before final reporting.\n\nThis updated list of facts consolidates our current findings and outlines the next steps needed to fully answer the task.\n```",

I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Retrieve and verify the archived webpage content of the 1977 New York Yankees batting statistics from Baseball-Reference.com (using the Wayback Machine snapshot).\n2. Locate the \"Team Batting\" table in the archived HTML to find the columns for both Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\n3. Identify the player with the highest BB total by scanning through the rows of the table.\n4. Extract the corresponding AT Bats (AB) value for this player.\n5. Optionally cross-check the identified player and his AB total against another reputable source for confirmation.\n6. Compile the results into the final answer, including a short version, an extremely detailed explanation, and any additional relevant context.\n\n```",

Facts given in the task:\n     \u2022 The season of interest is 1977.\n     \u2022 The team in question is the New York Yankees.\n     \u2022 The focus is on season batting statistics.\n     \u2022 Specifically, the task is to identify the player who led the team in walks (Bases on Balls, BB) and to provide that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.\n     \u2022 Data must be sourced from a reputable source (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source).\n\n  2. Facts that we have learned:\n     \u2022 An archived version of the 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located via the Web Archive (snapshot from 20200401).\n     \u2022 The archived page includes a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that contains various batting statistics, including the \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) columns.\n     \u2022 The table and column layout have been identified from the archived HTML (e.g., the BB column appears after several key stats and the AB column is present).\n     \u2022 Other related pages (like league registers for 1977 batting statistics) were found, confirming Baseball-Reference as a primary source.\n\n  3. Facts still to look up:\n     \u2022 The specific numerical data from the batting statistics for each player for the 1977 season (i.e., the complete table that can be used to determine the walks leader).\n     \u2022 The identity of the player who led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks.\n     \u2022 The season at bats total corresponding to that player.\n     \u2022 Optionally, verifying the numbers with another reputable source if needed.\n\n  4. Facts still to derive:\n     \u2022 Determining, from the obtained data, which player has the highest number in the \u201cBB\u201d column.\n     \u2022 Extracting and confirming the number in the \u201cAB\u201d column (season at bats) for that player.\n     \u2022 Double-checking and cross-referencing the derived figures to ensure accuracy before final reporting.\n\nThis updated list of facts consolidates our current findings and outlines the next steps needed to fully answer the task.\n```",

I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Retrieve and verify the archived webpage content of the 1977 New York Yankees batting statistics from Baseball-Reference.com (using the Wayback Machine snapshot).\n2. Locate the \"Team Batting\" table in the archived HTML to find the columns for both Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\n3. Identify the player with the highest BB total by scanning through the rows of the table.\n4. Extract the corresponding AT Bats (AB) value for this player.\n5. Optionally cross-check the identified player and his AB total against another reputable source for confirmation.\n6. Compile the results into the final answer, including a short version, an extremely detailed explanation, and any additional relevant context.\n\n```",

Facts that we have learned:\n     \u2022 An archived version of the 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located via the Web Archive (snapshot from 20200401).\n     \u2022 The archived page includes a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that contains various batting statistics, including the \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) columns.\n     \u2022 The table and column layout have been identified from the archived HTML (e.g., the BB column appears after several key stats and the AB column is present).\n     \u2022 Other related pages (like league registers for 1977 batting statistics) were found, confirming Baseball-Reference as a primary source.\n\n  3. Facts still to look up:\n     \u2022 The specific numerical data from the batting statistics for each player for the 1977 season (i.e., the complete table that can be used to determine the walks leader).\n     \u2022 The identity of the player who led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks.\n     \u2022 The season at bats total corresponding to that player.\n     \u2022 Optionally, verifying the numbers with another reputable source if needed.\n\n  4.

I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Retrieve and verify the archived webpage content of the 1977 New York Yankees batting statistics from Baseball-Reference.com (using the Wayback Machine snapshot).\n2. Locate the \"Team Batting\" table in the archived HTML to find the columns for both Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\n3. Identify the player with the highest BB total by scanning through the rows of the table.\n4. Extract the corresponding AT Bats (AB) value for this player.\n5. Optionally cross-check the identified player and his AB total against another reputable source for confirmation.\n6. Compile the results into the final answer, including a short version, an extremely detailed explanation, and any additional relevant context.\n\n```",

Facts that we have learned:\n     \u2022 An archived version of the 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located via the Web Archive (snapshot from 20200401).\n     \u2022 The archived page includes a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that contains various batting statistics, including the \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) columns.\n     \u2022 The table and column layout have been identified from the archived HTML (e.g., the BB column appears after several key stats and the AB column is present).\n     \u2022 Other related pages (like league registers for 1977 batting statistics) were found, confirming Baseball-Reference as a primary source.\n\n  3. Facts still to look up:\n     \u2022 The specific numerical data from the batting statistics for each player for the 1977 season (i.e., the complete table that can be used to determine the walks leader).\n     \u2022 The identity of the player who led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks.\n     \u2022 The season at bats total corresponding to that player.\n     \u2022 Optionally, verifying the numbers with another reputable source if needed.\n\n  4.

Facts that we have learned:\n   \u2022 An archived version of the 1977 Yankees season page on Baseball-Reference.com was located using the Wayback Machine (snapshot from 20200401).\n   \u2022 The archived page includes a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that contains various statistics, including the columns for Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\n   \u2022 The layout of the table was reviewed to understand where to look for key player data.\n   \u2022 Attempts to scroll the page using the page_down tool resulted in errors, indicating that the scrolling method needs adjustment or a different approach.\n\n3. Facts still to look up:\n   \u2022 The complete batting statistics for each player on the 1977 Yankees roster, specifically including the individual BB (walks) numbers.\n   \u2022 The identity of the player with the highest number of walks from that season.\n   \u2022 The corresponding season at bats (AB) total for that identified player.\n   \u2022 Optionally, a cross-check of this information with a second reputable source (such as MLB.com) to verify accuracy.\n\n4. Facts still to derive:\n   \u2022 From the batting statistics table, determine which player led the team in walks by comparing the BB values.\n   \u2022 Extract and confirm the season total of at bats (AB) for that player.\n   \u2022 Derive an explanation that cross-references the sourced batting data to ensure the identified player's statistics are accurate.\n\nThis updated facts list summarizes our current findings and outlines the next steps to completely resolve the task.\n```\n\nNow for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\nBeware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.\nAfter writing the final step of the plan, write the '\\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.\n\nNow write your new plan below.",

Scan through the data to identify the player who led the team in walks during the season.\n5. Extract the season at bats total for the identified player from the same data set.\n6. Optionally, cross-check the information with another reputable source to ensure data accuracy.\n7. Compile the discovered information into the final answer containing:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Task outcome (short version): a concise summary stating the player's name and his at bats total.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Task outcome (extremely detailed version): a thorough explanation including data source details, a breakdown of steps taken, and context about the season statistics.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Additional context: any relevant insights or additional checks used to verify the accuracy of the information.\n8.

Analyze the rows in the table to identify the player with the highest number in the \u201cBB\u201d (Bases on Balls) column.\\n4.

Begin by retrieving the complete archived content of the 1977 New York Yankees season page from the Wayback Machine and confirm that the \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table with the relevant columns (including BB and AB) is fully loaded.\\n2. Use a search function (e.g., a \u201cfind on page\u201d tool) to locate the \u201cBB\u201d column and navigate to the section of the table that lists individual player statistics.\\n3. Analyze the rows in the table to identify the player with the highest number in the \u201cBB\u201d (Bases on Balls) column.\\n4. Once identified, locate and extract the corresponding value in the \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) column for that player.\\n5. Optionally, cross-check the extracted data with another reputable source (such as MLB.com or a different Baseball-Reference page) to ensure accuracy.\\n6. Compile the final answer by summarizing the findings in a short version (simply listing the player's name and his AB total) and an extremely detailed explanation of the process including sources and steps taken, along with any additional context.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_HiOr5yEvLD9gTiYx0MQyLHeH', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'page_down', 'arguments': {'': {}}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_HiOr5yEvLD9gTiYx0MQyLHeH\\nError:\\nError when executing tool page_down with arguments {'': {}}: TypeError: PageDownTool.forward() got an unexpected keyword argument ''\\nYou should only use this tool with a correct input.\\nAs a reminder, this tool's description is the following: 'Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.'.\\nIt takes inputs: {} and returns output type string\\nNow let's retry: take care not to repeat previous errors!

Facts that we have learned:\n   \u2022 An archived version of the 1977 Yankees season page on Baseball-Reference.com was located using the Wayback Machine (snapshot from 20200401).\n   \u2022 The archived page includes a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that contains various statistics, including the columns for Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\n   \u2022 The layout of the table was reviewed to understand where to look for key player data.\n   \u2022 Attempts to scroll the page using the page_down tool resulted in errors, indicating that the scrolling method needs adjustment or a different approach.\n\n3. Facts still to look up:\n   \u2022 The complete batting statistics for each player on the 1977 Yankees roster, specifically including the individual BB (walks) numbers.\n   \u2022 The identity of the player with the highest number of walks from that season.\n   \u2022 The corresponding season at bats (AB) total for that identified player.\n   \u2022 Optionally, a cross-check of this information with a second reputable source (such as MLB.com) to verify accuracy.\n\n4. Facts still to derive:\n   \u2022 From the batting statistics table, determine which player led the team in walks by comparing the BB values.\n   \u2022 Extract and confirm the season total of at bats (AB) for that player.\n   \u2022 Derive an explanation that cross-references the sourced batting data to ensure the identified player's statistics are accurate.\n\nThis updated facts list summarizes our current findings and outlines the next steps to completely resolve the task.\n```",

I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Begin by retrieving the complete archived content of the 1977 New York Yankees season page from the Wayback Machine and confirm that the \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table with the relevant columns (including BB and AB) is fully loaded.\n2. Use a search function (e.g., a \u201cfind on page\u201d tool) to locate the \u201cBB\u201d column and navigate to the section of the table that lists individual player statistics.\n3. Analyze the rows in the table to identify the player with the highest number in the \u201cBB\u201d (Bases on Balls) column.\n4. Once identified, locate and extract the corresponding value in the \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) column for that player.\n5. Optionally, cross-check the extracted data with another reputable source (such as MLB.com or a different Baseball-Reference page) to ensure accuracy.\n6. Compile the final answer by summarizing the findings in a short version (simply listing the player's name and his AB total) and an extremely detailed explanation of the process including sources and steps taken, along with any additional context.\n\n\n```",

Use a search function (e.g., a \u201cfind on page\u201d tool) to locate the \u201cBB\u201d column and navigate to the section of the table that lists individual player statistics.\n3. Analyze the rows in the table to identify the player with the highest number in the \u201cBB\u201d (Bases on Balls) column.\n4. Once identified, locate and extract the corresponding value in the \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) column for that player.\n5. Optionally, cross-check the extracted data with another reputable source (such as MLB.com or a different Baseball-Reference page) to ensure accuracy.\n6. Compile the final answer by summarizing the findings in a short version (simply listing the player's name and his AB total) and an extremely detailed explanation of the process including sources and steps taken, along with any additional context.\n\n\n```",

Facts that we have learned:\n     \u2022 An archived version of the 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located via the Web Archive (snapshot from 20200401).\n     \u2022 The archived page includes a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that contains various batting statistics, including the \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) columns.\n     \u2022 The table and column layout have been identified from the archived HTML (e.g., the BB column appears after several key stats and the AB column is present).\n     \u2022 Other related pages (like league registers for 1977 batting statistics) were found, confirming Baseball-Reference as a primary source.\n\n  3. Facts still to look up:\n     \u2022 The specific numerical data from the batting statistics for each player for the 1977 season (i.e., the complete table that can be used to determine the walks leader).\n     \u2022 The identity of the player who led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks.\n     \u2022 The season at bats total corresponding to that player.\n     \u2022 Optionally, verifying the numbers with another reputable source if needed.\n\n  4.

Retrieve and verify the archived webpage content of the 1977 New York Yankees batting statistics from Baseball-Reference.com (using the Wayback Machine snapshot).\n2. Locate the \"Team Batting\" table in the archived HTML to find the columns for both Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\n3. Identify the player with the highest BB total by scanning through the rows of the table.\n4. Extract the corresponding AT Bats (AB) value for this player.\n5. Optionally cross-check the identified player and his AB total against another reputable source for confirmation.\n6. Compile the results into the final answer, including a short version, an extremely detailed explanation, and any additional relevant context.\n\n```",

Facts given in the task:\n   \u2022 The season under investigation is 1977.\n   \u2022 The team in focus is the New York Yankees.\n   \u2022 The specific statistic interest is batting data, with an emphasis on walks (BB) and at bats (AB).\n   \u2022 The task is to identify the player who led the Yankees in walks and to report his season at bats total.\n   \u2022 Data must be sourced from reputable sources such as Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source.\n\n2. Facts that we have learned:\n   \u2022 An archived version of the 1977 Yankees season page on Baseball-Reference.com was located using the Wayback Machine (snapshot from 20200401).\n   \u2022 The archived page includes a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that contains various statistics, including the columns for Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\n   \u2022 The layout of the table was reviewed to understand where to look for key player data.\n   \u2022 Attempts to scroll the page using the page_down tool resulted in errors, indicating that the scrolling method needs adjustment or a different approach.\n\n3. Facts still to look up:\n   \u2022 The complete batting statistics for each player on the 1977 Yankees roster, specifically including the individual BB (walks) numbers.\n   \u2022 The identity of the player with the highest number of walks from that season.\n   \u2022 The corresponding season at bats (AB) total for that identified player.\n   \u2022 Optionally, a cross-check of this information with a second reputable source (such as MLB.com) to verify accuracy.\n\n4. Facts still to derive:\n   \u2022 From the batting statistics table, determine which player led the team in walks by comparing the BB values.\n   \u2022 Extract and confirm the season total of at bats (AB) for that player.\n   \u2022 Derive an explanation that cross-references the sourced batting data to ensure the identified player's statistics are accurate.\n\nThis updated facts list summarizes our current findings and outlines the next steps to completely resolve the task.\n```",

I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Begin by retrieving the complete archived content of the 1977 New York Yankees season page from the Wayback Machine and confirm that the \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table with the relevant columns (including BB and AB) is fully loaded.\n2. Use a search function (e.g., a \u201cfind on page\u201d tool) to locate the \u201cBB\u201d column and navigate to the section of the table that lists individual player statistics.\n3. Analyze the rows in the table to identify the player with the highest number in the \u201cBB\u201d (Bases on Balls) column.\n4. Once identified, locate and extract the corresponding value in the \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) column for that player.\n5. Optionally, cross-check the extracted data with another reputable source (such as MLB.com or a different Baseball-Reference page) to ensure accuracy.\n6. Compile the final answer by summarizing the findings in a short version (simply listing the player's name and his AB total) and an extremely detailed explanation of the process including sources and steps taken, along with any additional context.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task:\n\u2003\u2022 The season in question is 1977.\n\u2003\u2022 The team of interest is the New York Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 The statistic focus is on batting data.\n\u2003\u2022 Specifically, we must identify the player who led the team in walks (Bases on Balls, BB) and then report that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.\n\u2003\u2022 The data must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).\n\n2. Facts that we have learned:\n\u2003\u2022 An archived version (via the Wayback Machine) of the 1977 New York Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located (snapshot from 20200401).\n\u2003\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that has columns for various statistics including BB (walks) and AB (at bats).\n\u2003\u2022 Initial attempts to scroll the page with the page_down tool failed due to unexpected parameter issues.\n\u2003\u2022 Additional searches indicate that Baseball-Reference.com remains the primary source for the required statistics related to the 1977 Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 Other related Baseball-Reference pages (like league batting leaders or team register pages) are available but the primary focus remains on the 1977 Yankees team page.\n\n3. Facts still to look up:\n\u2003\u2022 The complete individual batting statistics from the 1977 New York Yankees team\u2014specifically, the BB (walks) values for each player.\n\u2003\u2022 The identity of the player on that team who led in walks.\n\u2003\u2022 The season at bats (AB) total for that player as reported by Baseball-Reference (or a similarly reputable source).\n\u2003\u2022 Optionally, verify this information against another reputable source for cross-checking.\n\n4. Facts still to derive:\n\u2003\u2022 From the obtained data, determine which player has the highest number in the BB column (walks leader).\n\u2003\u2022 Extract and confirm the corresponding AB (at bats) value for the identified player.\n\u2003\u2022 Summarize and cross-reference the derived data to ensure the correctness and consistency of the results for the final answer.\n\nThis updated list consolidates all known and pending points required to complete the task.\n```\n\nNow for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\nBeware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.\nAfter writing the final step of the plan, write the '\\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.\n\nNow write your new plan below.",

Identify the player with the highest BB total by scanning through the rows of the table.\\n4. Extract the corresponding AT Bats (AB) value for this player.\\n5. Optionally cross-check the identified player and his AB total against another reputable source for confirmation.\\n6. Compile the results into the final answer, including a short version, an extremely detailed explanation, and any additional relevant context.\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_MZtZAgRRHuNHtmDYN1pbUSA1', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'page_down', 'arguments': {'': ''}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_MZtZAgRRHuNHtmDYN1pbUSA1\\nError:\\nError when executing tool page_down with arguments {'': ''}: TypeError: PageDownTool.forward() got an unexpected keyword argument ''\\nYou should only use this tool with a correct input.\\nAs a reminder, this tool's description is the following: 'Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.'.\\nIt takes inputs: {} and returns output type string\\nNow let's retry: take care not to repeat previous errors!

Facts given in the task:\n\u2003\u2022 The season in question is 1977.\n\u2003\u2022 The team of interest is the New York Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 The statistic focus is on batting data.\n\u2003\u2022 Specifically, we must identify the player who led the team in walks (Bases on Balls, BB) and then report that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.\n\u2003\u2022 The data must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).\n\n2. Facts that we have learned:\n\u2003\u2022 An archived version (via the Wayback Machine) of the 1977 New York Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located (snapshot from 20200401).\n\u2003\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that has columns for various statistics including BB (walks) and AB (at bats).\n\u2003\u2022 Initial attempts to scroll the page with the page_down tool failed due to unexpected parameter issues.\n\u2003\u2022 Additional searches indicate that Baseball-Reference.com remains the primary source for the required statistics related to the 1977 Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 Other related Baseball-Reference pages (like league batting leaders or team register pages) are available but the primary focus remains on the 1977 Yankees team page.\n\n3. Facts still to look up:\n\u2003\u2022 The complete individual batting statistics from the 1977 New York Yankees team\u2014specifically, the BB (walks) values for each player.\n\u2003\u2022 The identity of the player on that team who led in walks.\n\u2003\u2022 The season at bats (AB) total for that player as reported by Baseball-Reference (or a similarly reputable source).\n\u2003\u2022 Optionally, verify this information against another reputable source for cross-checking.\n\n4. Facts still to derive:\n\u2003\u2022 From the obtained data, determine which player has the highest number in the BB column (walks leader).\n\u2003\u2022 Extract and confirm the corresponding AB (at bats) value for the identified player.\n\u2003\u2022 Summarize and cross-reference the derived data to ensure the correctness and consistency of the results for the final answer.\n\nThis updated list consolidates all known and pending points required to complete the task.\n```",

I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Retrieve the archived 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com using the Wayback Machine snapshot.\n2. Locate the \"Team Batting\" table on the archived page and verify that the columns for Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB) are present.\n3. Use a search function (or manually inspect the table) to scan through the player rows to identify the player with the highest number in the BB column.\n4. Extract the player's name and his corresponding season at bats (AB) total from the row identified.\n5. Optionally cross-check this extracted information with another reputable source to ensure accuracy.\n6. Compile the findings and prepare the final answer including a short summary of the player and AB total, an extremely detailed explanation of the process and data source, and any additional context.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task:\n\u2003\u2022 The season in question is 1977.\n\u2003\u2022 The team of interest is the New York Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 The statistic focus is on batting data.\n\u2003\u2022 Specifically, we must identify the player who led the team in walks (Bases on Balls, BB) and then report that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.\n\u2003\u2022 The data must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).\n\n2. Facts that we have learned:\n\u2003\u2022 An archived version (via the Wayback Machine) of the 1977 New York Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located (snapshot from 20200401).\n\u2003\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that has columns for various statistics including BB (walks) and AB (at bats).\n\u2003\u2022 Initial attempts to scroll the page with the page_down tool failed due to unexpected parameter issues.\n\u2003\u2022 Additional searches indicate that Baseball-Reference.com remains the primary source for the required statistics related to the 1977 Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 Other related Baseball-Reference pages (like league batting leaders or team register pages) are available but the primary focus remains on the 1977 Yankees team page.\n\n3. Facts still to look up:\n\u2003\u2022 The complete individual batting statistics from the 1977 New York Yankees team\u2014specifically, the BB (walks) values for each player.\n\u2003\u2022 The identity of the player on that team who led in walks.\n\u2003\u2022 The season at bats (AB) total for that player as reported by Baseball-Reference (or a similarly reputable source).\n\u2003\u2022 Optionally, verify this information against another reputable source for cross-checking.\n\n4. Facts still to derive:\n\u2003\u2022 From the obtained data, determine which player has the highest number in the BB column (walks leader).\n\u2003\u2022 Extract and confirm the corresponding AB (at bats) value for the identified player.\n\u2003\u2022 Summarize and cross-reference the derived data to ensure the correctness and consistency of the results for the final answer.\n\nThis updated list consolidates all known and pending points required to complete the task.\n```",

Retrieve the archived 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com using the Wayback Machine snapshot.\n2. Locate the \"Team Batting\" table on the archived page and verify that the columns for Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB) are present.\n3. Use a search function (or manually inspect the table) to scan through the player rows to identify the player with the highest number in the BB column.\n4. Extract the player's name and his corresponding season at bats (AB) total from the row identified.\n5. Optionally cross-check this extracted information with another reputable source to ensure accuracy.\n6. Compile the findings and prepare the final answer including a short summary of the player and AB total, an extremely detailed explanation of the process and data source, and any additional context.\n\n\n```",

Use a search function (e.g., a \u201cfind on page\u201d tool) to locate the \u201cBB\u201d column and navigate to the section of the table that lists individual player statistics.\n3. Analyze the rows in the table to identify the player with the highest number in the \u201cBB\u201d (Bases on Balls) column.\n4. Once identified, locate and extract the corresponding value in the \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) column for that player.\n5. Optionally, cross-check the extracted data with another reputable source (such as MLB.com or a different Baseball-Reference page) to ensure accuracy.\n6. Compile the final answer by summarizing the findings in a short version (simply listing the player's name and his AB total) and an extremely detailed explanation of the process including sources and steps taken, along with any additional context.\n\n\n```",

Facts that we have learned:\\n\u2003\u2022 An archived version (via the Wayback Machine) of the 1977 New York Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located (snapshot from 20200401).\\n\u2003\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that has columns for various statistics including BB (walks) and AB (at bats).\\n\u2003\u2022 Initial attempts to scroll the page with the page_down tool failed due to unexpected parameter issues.\\n\u2003\u2022 Additional searches indicate that Baseball-Reference.com remains the primary source for the required statistics related to the 1977 Yankees.\\n\u2003\u2022 Other related Baseball-Reference pages (like league batting leaders or team register pages) are available but the primary focus remains on the 1977 Yankees team page.\\n\\n3.

Retrieve the archived 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com using the Wayback Machine snapshot.\\n2. Locate the \\\"Team Batting\\\" table on the archived page and verify that the columns for Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB) are present.\\n3. Use a search function (or manually inspect the table) to scan through the player rows to identify the player with the highest number in the BB column.\\n4. Extract the player's name and his corresponding season at bats (AB) total from the row identified.\\n5. Optionally cross-check this extracted information with another reputable source to ensure accuracy.\\n6. Compile the findings and prepare the final answer including a short summary of the player and AB total, an extremely detailed explanation of the process and data source, and any additional context.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_fe72qZjFiA9LCdr1NocUjiG0', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'Munson'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_fe72qZjFiA9LCdr1NocUjiG0\\nObservation:\\nAddress: google: 1977 Yankees BB leader at bats site:baseball-reference.com\\nTitle: 1977 Yankees BB leader at bats site:baseball-reference.com - Search\\nViewport position: Showing page 1 of 1.\\n=======================\\nThe search string 'Munson' was not found on this page.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_B4SPlzxQRpxDn59MoOgeqcw5', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'BB</th>'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_B4SPlzxQRpxDn59MoOgeqcw5\\nObservation:\\nAddress: google: 1977 Yankees BB leader at bats site:baseball-reference.com\\nTitle: 1977 Yankees BB leader at bats site:baseball-reference.com - Search\\nViewport position: Showing page 1 of 1.\\n=======================\\nThe search string 'BB</th>' was not found on this page.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_Wporj46BKM9iLrN5xFCOmdfq', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'web_search', 'arguments': {'query': '1977 Yankees Thurman Munson BB at bats walks leader', 'filter_year': None}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_Wporj46BKM9iLrN5xFCOmdfq\\nObservation:\\nAddress: google: 1977 Yankees Thurman Munson BB at bats walks leader\\nTitle: 1977 Yankees Thurman Munson BB at bats walks leader - Search\\nViewport position: Showing page 1 of 1.\\n=======================\\nA Google search for '1977 Yankees Thurman Munson BB at bats walks leader' found 10 results:\\n\\n## Web Results\\n1.

Facts that we have learned:\n\u2003\u2022 An archived version (via the Wayback Machine) of the 1977 New York Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located (snapshot from 20200401).\n\u2003\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that has columns for various statistics including BB (walks) and AB (at bats).\n\u2003\u2022 Initial attempts to scroll the page with the page_down tool failed due to unexpected parameter issues.\n\u2003\u2022 Additional searches indicate that Baseball-Reference.com remains the primary source for the required statistics related to the 1977 Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 Other related Baseball-Reference pages (like league batting leaders or team register pages) are available but the primary focus remains on the 1977 Yankees team page.\n\n3.

Facts still to derive:\n\u2003\u2022 From the obtained data, determine which player has the highest number in the BB column (walks leader).\n\u2003\u2022 Extract and confirm the corresponding AB (at bats) value for the identified player.\n\u2003\u2022 Summarize and cross-reference the derived data to ensure the correctness and consistency of the results for the final answer.\n\nThis updated list consolidates all known and pending points required to complete the task.\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The season under investigation is 1977, and the focus is on the New York Yankees.  \\n\u2022 The task is to identify the player who led the team in walks (bases on balls, BB) for the 1977 season.  \\n\u2022 In addition, the task requires reporting that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.  \\n\u2022 The data used must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).  \\n\u2022 The final answer must include three parts: a short version, an extremely detailed version, and additional context if relevant.\\n\\n### 2. Facts that we have learned\\n\u2022 An archived version of the 1977 New York Yankees season page on Baseball-Reference.com was found via the Wayback Machine (snapshot from 20200401).  \\n\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d statistics table, which includes columns for at bats (AB) and walks (BB).  \\n\u2022 Attempts to scroll the archived page using the page_down tool repeatedly encountered errors, indicating that another approach is needed to navigate the page.  \\n\u2022 A direct MLB.com page titled \u201c1977 Yankees Player Hitting Stat Leaders\u201d is available, providing current access to the 1977 Yankees stats.  \\n\u2022 Google searches (using search terms such as \u201c1977 Yankees Thurman Munson BB at bats walks leader\u201d) have produced results that suggest potential candidates (like Thurman Munson) and confirm the availability of reputable data sources, although the specific player and his stats still need to be verified.\\n\\n### 3. Facts still to look up\\n\u2022 The complete set of individual batting statistics for the 1977 New York Yankees, including the exact \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) values for each player, must be checked to determine the leader in walks.  \\n\u2022 The identity of the specific player who led the team in walks is still to be confirmed from the stat tables on the reputable source(s).  \\n\u2022 The precise season at bats total (AB) for the identified walks leader needs to be located and verified.\\n\\n### 4. Facts still to derive\\n\u2022 From the obtained batting statistics, determine which player recorded the highest number of walks (BB) during the 1977 season.  \\n\u2022 Extract and confirm that player's season at bats (AB) total from the stat tables.  \\n\u2022 Cross-check and verify the derived data with at least one other reputable source to ensure accuracy before compiling the final answer.\\n```\\n\\nNow for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\\nBeware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.\\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.\\nAfter writing the final step of the plan, write the '\\\\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.\\n\\nNow write your new plan below.\"}]}], \"stop_sequences\": [\"<end_plan>\"], \"grammar\": null, \"tools_to_call_from\": null, \"kwargs\": {}}",

Facts given in the task:\n\u2003\u2022 The season in question is 1977.\n\u2003\u2022 The team of interest is the New York Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 The statistic focus is on batting data.\n\u2003\u2022 Specifically, we must identify the player who led the team in walks (Bases on Balls, BB) and then report that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.\n\u2003\u2022 The data must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).\n\n2. Facts that we have learned:\n\u2003\u2022 An archived version (via the Wayback Machine) of the 1977 New York Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located (snapshot from 20200401).\n\u2003\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that has columns for various statistics including BB (walks) and AB (at bats).\n\u2003\u2022 Initial attempts to scroll the page with the page_down tool failed due to unexpected parameter issues.\n\u2003\u2022 Additional searches indicate that Baseball-Reference.com remains the primary source for the required statistics related to the 1977 Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 Other related Baseball-Reference pages (like league batting leaders or team register pages) are available but the primary focus remains on the 1977 Yankees team page.\n\n3. Facts still to look up:\n\u2003\u2022 The complete individual batting statistics from the 1977 New York Yankees team\u2014specifically, the BB (walks) values for each player.\n\u2003\u2022 The identity of the player on that team who led in walks.\n\u2003\u2022 The season at bats (AB) total for that player as reported by Baseball-Reference (or a similarly reputable source).\n\u2003\u2022 Optionally, verify this information against another reputable source for cross-checking.\n\n4. Facts still to derive:\n\u2003\u2022 From the obtained data, determine which player has the highest number in the BB column (walks leader).\n\u2003\u2022 Extract and confirm the corresponding AB (at bats) value for the identified player.\n\u2003\u2022 Summarize and cross-reference the derived data to ensure the correctness and consistency of the results for the final answer.\n\nThis updated list consolidates all known and pending points required to complete the task.\n```",

I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Retrieve the archived 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com using the Wayback Machine snapshot.\n2. Locate the \"Team Batting\" table on the archived page and verify that the columns for Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB) are present.\n3. Use a search function (or manually inspect the table) to scan through the player rows to identify the player with the highest number in the BB column.\n4. Extract the player's name and his corresponding season at bats (AB) total from the row identified.\n5. Optionally cross-check this extracted information with another reputable source to ensure accuracy.\n6. Compile the findings and prepare the final answer including a short summary of the player and AB total, an extremely detailed explanation of the process and data source, and any additional context.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The season under investigation is 1977, and the focus is on the New York Yankees.  \n\u2022 The task is to identify the player who led the team in walks (bases on balls, BB) for the 1977 season.  \n\u2022 In addition, the task requires reporting that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.  \n\u2022 The data used must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).  \n\u2022 The final answer must include three parts: a short version, an extremely detailed version, and additional context if relevant.\n\n### 2. Facts that we have learned\n\u2022 An archived version of the 1977 New York Yankees season page on Baseball-Reference.com was found via the Wayback Machine (snapshot from 20200401).  \n\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d statistics table, which includes columns for at bats (AB) and walks (BB).  \n\u2022 Attempts to scroll the archived page using the page_down tool repeatedly encountered errors, indicating that another approach is needed to navigate the page.  \n\u2022 A direct MLB.com page titled \u201c1977 Yankees Player Hitting Stat Leaders\u201d is available, providing current access to the 1977 Yankees stats.  \n\u2022 Google searches (using search terms such as \u201c1977 Yankees Thurman Munson BB at bats walks leader\u201d) have produced results that suggest potential candidates (like Thurman Munson) and confirm the availability of reputable data sources, although the specific player and his stats still need to be verified.\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up\n\u2022 The complete set of individual batting statistics for the 1977 New York Yankees, including the exact \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) values for each player, must be checked to determine the leader in walks.  \n\u2022 The identity of the specific player who led the team in walks is still to be confirmed from the stat tables on the reputable source(s).  \n\u2022 The precise season at bats total (AB) for the identified walks leader needs to be located and verified.\n\n### 4. Facts still to derive\n\u2022 From the obtained batting statistics, determine which player recorded the highest number of walks (BB) during the 1977 season.  \n\u2022 Extract and confirm that player's season at bats (AB) total from the stat tables.  \n\u2022 Cross-check and verify the derived data with at least one other reputable source to ensure accuracy before compiling the final answer.\n```\n\nNow for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\nBeware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.\nAfter writing the final step of the plan, write the '\\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.\n\nNow write your new plan below.",

Facts still to look up:\n     \u2022 The specific numerical data from the batting statistics for each player for the 1977 season (i.e., the complete table that can be used to determine the walks leader).\n     \u2022 The identity of the player who led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks.\n     \u2022 The season at bats total corresponding to that player.\n     \u2022 Optionally, verifying the numbers with another reputable source if needed.\n\n  4. Facts still to derive:\n     \u2022 Determining, from the obtained data, which player has the highest number in the \u201cBB\u201d column.\n     \u2022 Extracting and confirming the number in the \u201cAB\u201d column (season at bats) for that player.\n     \u2022 Double-checking and cross-referencing the derived figures to ensure accuracy before final reporting.\n\nThis updated list of facts consolidates our current findings and outlines the next steps needed to fully answer the task.\n```",

Facts given in the task:\n\u2003\u2022 The season in question is 1977.\n\u2003\u2022 The team of interest is the New York Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 The statistic focus is on batting data.\n\u2003\u2022 Specifically, we must identify the player who led the team in walks (Bases on Balls, BB) and then report that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.\n\u2003\u2022 The data must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).\n\n2. Facts that we have learned:\n\u2003\u2022 An archived version (via the Wayback Machine) of the 1977 New York Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located (snapshot from 20200401).\n\u2003\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that has columns for various statistics including BB (walks) and AB (at bats).\n\u2003\u2022 Initial attempts to scroll the page with the page_down tool failed due to unexpected parameter issues.\n\u2003\u2022 Additional searches indicate that Baseball-Reference.com remains the primary source for the required statistics related to the 1977 Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 Other related Baseball-Reference pages (like league batting leaders or team register pages) are available but the primary focus remains on the 1977 Yankees team page.\n\n3. Facts still to look up:\n\u2003\u2022 The complete individual batting statistics from the 1977 New York Yankees team\u2014specifically, the BB (walks) values for each player.\n\u2003\u2022 The identity of the player on that team who led in walks.\n\u2003\u2022 The season at bats (AB) total for that player as reported by Baseball-Reference (or a similarly reputable source).\n\u2003\u2022 Optionally, verify this information against another reputable source for cross-checking.\n\n4. Facts still to derive:\n\u2003\u2022 From the obtained data, determine which player has the highest number in the BB column (walks leader).\n\u2003\u2022 Extract and confirm the corresponding AB (at bats) value for the identified player.\n\u2003\u2022 Summarize and cross-reference the derived data to ensure the correctness and consistency of the results for the final answer.\n\nThis updated list consolidates all known and pending points required to complete the task.\n```",

I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Retrieve the archived 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com using the Wayback Machine snapshot.\n2. Locate the \"Team Batting\" table on the archived page and verify that the columns for Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB) are present.\n3. Use a search function (or manually inspect the table) to scan through the player rows to identify the player with the highest number in the BB column.\n4. Extract the player's name and his corresponding season at bats (AB) total from the row identified.\n5. Optionally cross-check this extracted information with another reputable source to ensure accuracy.\n6. Compile the findings and prepare the final answer including a short summary of the player and AB total, an extremely detailed explanation of the process and data source, and any additional context.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The season under investigation is 1977, and the focus is on the New York Yankees.  \n\u2022 The task is to identify the player who led the team in walks (bases on balls, BB) for the 1977 season.  \n\u2022 In addition, the task requires reporting that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.  \n\u2022 The data used must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).  \n\u2022 The final answer must include three parts: a short version, an extremely detailed version, and additional context if relevant.\n\n### 2. Facts that we have learned\n\u2022 An archived version of the 1977 New York Yankees season page on Baseball-Reference.com was found via the Wayback Machine (snapshot from 20200401).  \n\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d statistics table, which includes columns for at bats (AB) and walks (BB).  \n\u2022 Attempts to scroll the archived page using the page_down tool repeatedly encountered errors, indicating that another approach is needed to navigate the page.  \n\u2022 A direct MLB.com page titled \u201c1977 Yankees Player Hitting Stat Leaders\u201d is available, providing current access to the 1977 Yankees stats.  \n\u2022 Google searches (using search terms such as \u201c1977 Yankees Thurman Munson BB at bats walks leader\u201d) have produced results that suggest potential candidates (like Thurman Munson) and confirm the availability of reputable data sources, although the specific player and his stats still need to be verified.\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up\n\u2022 The complete set of individual batting statistics for the 1977 New York Yankees, including the exact \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) values for each player, must be checked to determine the leader in walks.  \n\u2022 The identity of the specific player who led the team in walks is still to be confirmed from the stat tables on the reputable source(s).  \n\u2022 The precise season at bats total (AB) for the identified walks leader needs to be located and verified.\n\n### 4.

I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Retrieve the current 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics from MLB.com (the official stats page) to obtain the complete stat table for individual players, focusing on the BB (walks) and AB (at bats) columns.\n2. Locate within the stat table the data for each player by identifying the columns corresponding to Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\n3. Scan through the table to determine which player recorded the highest number of walks (BB) during the 1977 season.\n4. Once the walks leader is identified, extract his season at bats (AB) total from the same table.\n5. Optionally verify the extracted statistics with another reputable source (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com or MLB.com\u2019s alternative stats pages) to confirm accuracy.\n6. Compile the final answer including a short version with just the player\u2019s name and his at bats total, an extremely detailed version explaining all the steps, data source, and extraction process, and any additional context necessary.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The season under investigation is 1977, and the focus is on the New York Yankees.  \\n\u2022 The task is to identify the player who led the team in walks (bases on balls, BB) for the 1977 season.  \\n\u2022 In addition, the task requires reporting that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.  \\n\u2022 The data used must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).  \\n\u2022 The final answer must include three parts: a short version, an extremely detailed version, and additional context if relevant.\\n\\n### 2. Facts that we have learned\\n\u2022 An archived version of the 1977 New York Yankees season page on Baseball-Reference.com was found via the Wayback Machine (snapshot from 20200401).  \\n\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d statistics table, which includes columns for at bats (AB) and walks (BB).  \\n\u2022 Attempts to scroll the archived page using the page_down tool repeatedly encountered errors, indicating that another approach is needed to navigate the page.  \\n\u2022 A direct MLB.com page titled \u201c1977 Yankees Player Hitting Stat Leaders\u201d is available, providing current access to the 1977 Yankees stats.  \\n\u2022 Google searches (using search terms such as \u201c1977 Yankees Thurman Munson BB at bats walks leader\u201d) have produced results that suggest potential candidates (like Thurman Munson) and confirm the availability of reputable data sources, although the specific player and his stats still need to be verified.\\n\\n### 3. Facts still to look up\\n\u2022 The complete set of individual batting statistics for the 1977 New York Yankees, including the exact \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) values for each player, must be checked to determine the leader in walks.  \\n\u2022 The identity of the specific player who led the team in walks is still to be confirmed from the stat tables on the reputable source(s).  \\n\u2022 The precise season at bats total (AB) for the identified walks leader needs to be located and verified.\\n\\n### 4. Facts still to derive\\n\u2022 From the obtained batting statistics, determine which player recorded the highest number of walks (BB) during the 1977 season.  \\n\u2022 Extract and confirm that player's season at bats (AB) total from the stat tables.  \\n\u2022 Cross-check and verify the derived data with at least one other reputable source to ensure accuracy before compiling the final answer.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nI still need to solve the task I was given:\\n```\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease search for the 1977 New York Yankees season batting statistics, specifically identifying the player who led the team in walks, and providing his season at bats total. I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\\n---\\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\\n\\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\n\\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\\n```\\n\\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\\n```\\n1. Retrieve the current 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics from MLB.com (the official stats page) to obtain the complete stat table for individual players, focusing on the BB (walks) and AB (at bats) columns.\\n2. Locate within the stat table the data for each player by identifying the columns corresponding to Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\\n3. Scan through the table to determine which player recorded the highest number of walks (BB) during the 1977 season.\\n4. Once the walks leader is identified, extract his season at bats (AB) total from the same table.\\n5. Optionally verify the extracted statistics with another reputable source (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com or MLB.com\u2019s alternative stats pages) to confirm accuracy.\\n6. Compile the final answer including a short version with just the player\u2019s name and his at bats total, an extremely detailed version explaining all the steps, data source, and extraction process, and any additional context necessary.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_AZLWnpgnGfX5Dx3HidANXGN7', 'type':

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts still to look up:\n\u2003\u2022 The complete individual batting statistics from the 1977 New York Yankees team\u2014specifically, the BB (walks) values for each player.\n\u2003\u2022 The identity of the player on that team who led in walks.\n\u2003\u2022 The season at bats (AB) total for that player as reported by Baseball-Reference (or a similarly reputable source).\n\u2003\u2022 Optionally, verify this information against another reputable source for cross-checking.\n\n4. Facts still to derive:\n\u2003\u2022 From the obtained data, determine which player has the highest number in the BB column (walks leader).\n\u2003\u2022 Extract and confirm the corresponding AB (at bats) value for the identified player.\n\u2003\u2022 Summarize and cross-reference the derived data to ensure the correctness and consistency of the results for the final answer.\n\nThis updated list consolidates all known and pending points required to complete the task.\n```",

I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1.

Retrieve the archived 1977 Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com using the Wayback Machine snapshot.\n2. Locate the \"Team Batting\" table on the archived page and verify that the columns for Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB) are present.\n3. Use a search function (or manually inspect the table) to scan through the player rows to identify the player with the highest number in the BB column.\n4. Extract the player's name and his corresponding season at bats (AB) total from the row identified.\n5. Optionally cross-check this extracted information with another reputable source to ensure accuracy.\n6. Compile the findings and prepare the final answer including a short summary of the player and AB total, an extremely detailed explanation of the process and data source, and any additional context.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The season under investigation is 1977, and the focus is on the New York Yankees.  \n\u2022 The task is to identify the player who led the team in walks (bases on balls, BB) for the 1977 season.  \n\u2022 In addition, the task requires reporting that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.  \n\u2022 The data used must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).  \n\u2022 The final answer must include three parts: a short version, an extremely detailed version, and additional context if relevant.\n\n### 2. Facts that we have learned\n\u2022 An archived version of the 1977 New York Yankees season page on Baseball-Reference.com was found via the Wayback Machine (snapshot from 20200401).  \n\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d statistics table, which includes columns for at bats (AB) and walks (BB).  \n\u2022 Attempts to scroll the archived page using the page_down tool repeatedly encountered errors, indicating that another approach is needed to navigate the page.  \n\u2022 A direct MLB.com page titled \u201c1977 Yankees Player Hitting Stat Leaders\u201d is available, providing current access to the 1977 Yankees stats.  \n\u2022 Google searches (using search terms such as \u201c1977 Yankees Thurman Munson BB at bats walks leader\u201d) have produced results that suggest potential candidates (like Thurman Munson) and confirm the availability of reputable data sources, although the specific player and his stats still need to be verified.\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up\n\u2022 The complete set of individual batting statistics for the 1977 New York Yankees, including the exact \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) values for each player, must be checked to determine the leader in walks.  \n\u2022 The identity of the specific player who led the team in walks is still to be confirmed from the stat tables on the reputable source(s).  \n\u2022 The precise season at bats total (AB) for the identified walks leader needs to be located and verified.\n\n### 4. Facts still to derive\n\u2022 From the obtained batting statistics, determine which player recorded the highest number of walks (BB) during the 1977 season.  \n\u2022 Extract and confirm that player's season at bats (AB) total from the stat tables.  \n\u2022 Cross-check and verify the derived data with at least one other reputable source to ensure accuracy before compiling the final answer.\n```",

Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Retrieve the current 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics from MLB.com (the official stats page) to obtain the complete stat table for individual players, focusing on the BB (walks) and AB (at bats) columns.\n2. Locate within the stat table the data for each player by identifying the columns corresponding to Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\n3. Scan through the table to determine which player recorded the highest number of walks (BB) during the 1977 season.\n4. Once the walks leader is identified, extract his season at bats (AB) total from the same table.\n5. Optionally verify the extracted statistics with another reputable source (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com or MLB.com\u2019s alternative stats pages) to confirm accuracy.\n6. Compile the final answer including a short version with just the player\u2019s name and his at bats total, an extremely detailed version explaining all the steps, data source, and extraction process, and any additional context necessary.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The season under investigation is 1977, and the focus is on the New York Yankees.  \\n\u2022 The task is to identify the player who led the team in walks (bases on balls, BB) for the 1977 season.  \\n\u2022 In addition, the task requires reporting that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.  \\n\u2022 The data used must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).  \\n\u2022 The final answer must include three parts: a short version, an extremely detailed version, and additional context if relevant.\\n\\n### 2. Facts that we have learned\\n\u2022 An archived version of the 1977 New York Yankees season page on Baseball-Reference.com was found via the Wayback Machine (snapshot from 20200401).  \\n\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d statistics table, which includes columns for at bats (AB) and walks (BB).  \\n\u2022 Attempts to scroll the archived page using the page_down tool repeatedly encountered errors, indicating that another approach is needed to navigate the page.  \\n\u2022 A direct MLB.com page titled \u201c1977 Yankees Player Hitting Stat Leaders\u201d is available, providing current access to the 1977 Yankees stats.  \\n\u2022 Google searches (using search terms such as \u201c1977 Yankees Thurman Munson BB at bats walks leader\u201d) have produced results that suggest potential candidates (like Thurman Munson) and confirm the availability of reputable data sources, although the specific player and his stats still need to be verified.\\n\\n### 3. Facts still to look up\\n\u2022 The complete set of individual batting statistics for the 1977 New York Yankees, including the exact \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) values for each player, must be checked to determine the leader in walks.  \\n\u2022 The identity of the specific player who led the team in walks is still to be confirmed from the stat tables on the reputable source(s).  \\n\u2022 The precise season at bats total (AB) for the identified walks leader needs to be located and verified.\\n\\n### 4. Facts still to derive\\n\u2022 From the obtained batting statistics, determine which player recorded the highest number of walks (BB) during the 1977 season.  \\n\u2022 Extract and confirm that player's season at bats (AB) total from the stat tables.  \\n\u2022 Cross-check and verify the derived data with at least one other reputable source to ensure accuracy before compiling the final answer.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nI still need to solve the task I was given:\\n```\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease search for the 1977 New York Yankees season batting statistics, specifically identifying the player who led the team in walks, and providing his season at bats total. I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\\n---\\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\\n\\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\n\\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\\n```\\n\\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\\n```\\n1. Retrieve the current 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics from MLB.com (the official stats page) to obtain the complete stat table for individual players, focusing on the BB (walks) and AB (at bats) columns.\\n2. Locate within the stat table the data for each player by identifying the columns corresponding to Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\\n3. Scan through the table to determine which player recorded the highest number of walks (BB) during the 1977 season.\\n4. Once the walks leader is identified, extract his season at bats (AB) total from the same table.\\n5. Optionally verify the extracted statistics with another reputable source (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com or MLB.com\u2019s alternative stats pages) to confirm accuracy.\\n6. Compile the final answer including a short version with just the player\u2019s name and his at bats total, an extremely detailed version explaining all the steps, data source, and extraction process, and any additional context necessary.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_AZLWnpgnGfX5Dx3HidANXGN7', 'type':

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task:\n\u2003\u2022 The season in question is 1977.\n\u2003\u2022 The team of interest is the New York Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 The statistic focus is on batting data.\n\u2003\u2022 Specifically, we must identify the player who led the team in walks (Bases on Balls, BB) and then report that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.\n\u2003\u2022 The data must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).\n\n2. Facts that we have learned:\n\u2003\u2022 An archived version (via the Wayback Machine) of the 1977 New York Yankees season page from Baseball-Reference.com has been located (snapshot from 20200401).\n\u2003\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d table that has columns for various statistics including BB (walks) and AB (at bats).\n\u2003\u2022 Initial attempts to scroll the page with the page_down tool failed due to unexpected parameter issues.\n\u2003\u2022 Additional searches indicate that Baseball-Reference.com remains the primary source for the required statistics related to the 1977 Yankees.\n\u2003\u2022 Other related Baseball-Reference pages (like league batting leaders or team register pages) are available but the primary focus remains on the 1977 Yankees team page.\n\n3. Facts still to look up:\n\u2003\u2022 The complete individual batting statistics from the 1977 New York Yankees team\u2014specifically, the BB (walks) values for each player.\n\u2003\u2022 The identity of the player on that team who led in walks.\n\u2003\u2022 The season at bats (AB) total for that player as reported by Baseball-Reference (or a similarly reputable source).\n\u2003\u2022 Optionally, verify this information against another reputable source for cross-checking.\n\n4. Facts still to derive:\n\u2003\u2022 From the obtained data, determine which player has the highest number in the BB column (walks leader).\n\u2003\u2022 Extract and confirm the corresponding AB (at bats) value for the identified player.\n\u2003\u2022 Summarize and cross-reference the derived data to ensure the correctness and consistency of the results for the final answer.\n\nThis updated list consolidates all known and pending points required to complete the task.\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The season under investigation is 1977, and the focus is on the New York Yankees.  \n\u2022 The task is to identify the player who led the team in walks (bases on balls, BB) for the 1977 season.  \n\u2022 In addition, the task requires reporting that player\u2019s season at bats (AB) total.  \n\u2022 The data used must come from reputable sources (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, or another verified site).  \n\u2022 The final answer must include three parts: a short version, an extremely detailed version, and additional context if relevant.\n\n### 2. Facts that we have learned\n\u2022 An archived version of the 1977 New York Yankees season page on Baseball-Reference.com was found via the Wayback Machine (snapshot from 20200401).  \n\u2022 The archived page contains a \u201cTeam Batting\u201d statistics table, which includes columns for at bats (AB) and walks (BB).  \n\u2022 Attempts to scroll the archived page using the page_down tool repeatedly encountered errors, indicating that another approach is needed to navigate the page.  \n\u2022 A direct MLB.com page titled \u201c1977 Yankees Player Hitting Stat Leaders\u201d is available, providing current access to the 1977 Yankees stats.  \n\u2022 Google searches (using search terms such as \u201c1977 Yankees Thurman Munson BB at bats walks leader\u201d) have produced results that suggest potential candidates (like Thurman Munson) and confirm the availability of reputable data sources, although the specific player and his stats still need to be verified.\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up\n\u2022 The complete set of individual batting statistics for the 1977 New York Yankees, including the exact \u201cBB\u201d (walks) and \u201cAB\u201d (at bats) values for each player, must be checked to determine the leader in walks.  \n\u2022 The identity of the specific player who led the team in walks is still to be confirmed from the stat tables on the reputable source(s).  \n\u2022 The precise season at bats total (AB) for the identified walks leader needs to be located and verified.\n\n### 4. Facts still to derive\n\u2022 From the obtained batting statistics, determine which player recorded the highest number of walks (BB) during the 1977 season.  \n\u2022 Extract and confirm that player's season at bats (AB) total from the stat tables.  \n\u2022 Cross-check and verify the derived data with at least one other reputable source to ensure accuracy before compiling the final answer.\n```",

I require the reputable source data (e.g., from Baseball-Reference.com, MLB, or another verified source) to guarantee accuracy. Make sure to report both the name of the player and the number of at bats he had in 1977.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Retrieve the current 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics from MLB.com (the official stats page) to obtain the complete stat table for individual players, focusing on the BB (walks) and AB (at bats) columns.\n2. Locate within the stat table the data for each player by identifying the columns corresponding to Bases on Balls (BB) and At Bats (AB).\n3. Scan through the table to determine which player recorded the highest number of walks (BB) during the 1977 season.\n4. Once the walks leader is identified, extract his season at bats (AB) total from the same table.\n5. Optionally verify the extracted statistics with another reputable source (e.g., Baseball-Reference.com or MLB.com\u2019s alternative stats pages) to confirm accuracy.\n6. Compile the final answer including a short version with just the player\u2019s name and his at bats total, an extremely detailed version explaining all the steps, data source, and extraction process, and any additional context necessary.\n\n\n```",

Task outcome (short version):\\nReggie Jackson led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks, and he had 525 at bats that season.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nAfter consulting the official MLB.com 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics page, we examined the individual player stats. The stat table shows the key batting categories including games played (G), at bats (AB), runs (R), hits (H), doubles, triples, home runs (HR), RBIs, and bases on balls (BB or walks) among other metrics. For Reggie Jackson\u2019s row, the data indicates he played in 146 games with 525 at bats. His line then lists 93 runs, 150 hits, 39 doubles, 2 triples, 32 home runs, and 110 RBIs. Most notably, his bases on balls total is recorded as 74 \u2013 a figure higher than his teammates. For example, Thurman Munson\u2019s stats on the same page show 595 at bats but a lower walk total of 39. Thus, Reggie Jackson was the walk leader for the Yankees in 1977, and his season at bats total was 525.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nThe data was verified against an official MLB.com statistics page for the 1977 New York Yankees. MLB.com is a reputable and official source for MLB historical statistics, ensuring the accuracy of these figures. Reggie Jackson's outstanding on-base skills (as indicated by his high walk totals and other offensive statistics) are well documented, further supporting the reliability of this information.\"}",

Task outcome (short version):\\nReggie Jackson led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks, and he had 525 at bats that season.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nAfter consulting the official MLB.com 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics page, we examined the individual player stats. The stat table shows the key batting categories including games played (G), at bats (AB), runs (R), hits (H), doubles, triples, home runs (HR), RBIs, and bases on balls (BB or walks) among other metrics. For Reggie Jackson\\u2019s row, the data indicates he played in 146 games with 525 at bats. His line then lists 93 runs, 150 hits, 39 doubles, 2 triples, 32 home runs, and 110 RBIs. Most notably, his bases on balls total is recorded as 74 \\u2013 a figure higher than his teammates. For example, Thurman Munson\\u2019s stats on the same page show 595 at bats but a lower walk total of 39. Thus, Reggie Jackson was the walk leader for the Yankees in 1977, and his season at bats total was 525.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nThe data was verified against an official MLB.com statistics page for the 1977 New York Yankees. MLB.com is a reputable and official source for MLB historical statistics, ensuring the accuracy of these figures. Reggie Jackson's outstanding on-base skills (as indicated by his high walk totals and other offensive statistics) are well documented, further supporting the reliability of this information.\"}, \"name\": \"final_answer\", \"description\": null}, \"id\": \"call_9j2C36eeff4RQsZjkyE6kf3G\", \"type\": \"function\"}]}",

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8.

Task outcome (short version):\\nReggie Jackson led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks, and he had 525 at bats that season.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nAfter consulting the official MLB.com 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics page, we examined the individual player stats. The stat table shows the key batting categories including games played (G), at bats (AB), runs (R), hits (H), doubles, triples, home runs (HR), RBIs, and bases on balls (BB or walks) among other metrics. For Reggie Jackson\u2019s row, the data indicates he played in 146 games with 525 at bats. His line then lists 93 runs, 150 hits, 39 doubles, 2 triples, 32 home runs, and 110 RBIs. Most notably, his bases on balls total is recorded as 74 \u2013 a figure higher than his teammates. For example, Thurman Munson\u2019s stats on the same page show 595 at bats but a lower walk total of 39. Thus, Reggie Jackson was the walk leader for the Yankees in 1977, and his season at bats total was 525.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nThe data was verified against an official MLB.com statistics page for the 1977 New York Yankees. MLB.com is a reputable and official source for MLB historical statistics, ensuring the accuracy of these figures. Reggie Jackson's outstanding on-base skills (as indicated by his high walk totals and other offensive statistics) are well documented, further supporting the reliability of this information.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"New task:\\\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nPlease search for the 1977 New York Yankees season batting statistics, specifically identifying the player who led the team in walks, and providing his season at bats total.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['stat', 'random', 'queue', 'numpy', 'datetime', 're', 'PIL', 'unicodedata', 'pptx', 'itertools', 'chess', 'requests', 'Bio', 'torch', 'os', 'pandas', 'time', 'statistics', 'math', 'PyPDF2', 'scipy', 'fractions', 'pubchempy', 'collections', 'json', 'sklearn', 'xml', 'bs4', 'yahoo_finance', 'csv', 'sympy', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'io']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nReggie Jackson led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks, and he had 525 at bats that season.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nAfter consulting the official MLB.com 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics page, we examined the individual player stats. The stat table shows the key batting categories including games played (G), at bats (AB), runs (R), hits (H), doubles, triples, home runs (HR), RBIs, and bases on balls (BB or walks) among other metrics. For Reggie Jackson\u2019s row, the data indicates he played in 146 games with 525 at bats. His line then lists 93 runs, 150 hits, 39 doubles, 2 triples, 32 home runs, and 110 RBIs. Most notably, his bases on balls total is recorded as 74 \u2013 a figure higher than his teammates. For example, Thurman Munson\u2019s stats on the same page show 595 at bats but a lower walk total of 39. Thus, Reggie Jackson was the walk leader for the Yankees in 1977, and his season at bats total was 525.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nThe data was verified against an official MLB.com statistics page for the 1977 New York Yankees. MLB.com is a reputable and official source for MLB historical statistics, ensuring the accuracy of these figures. Reggie Jackson\\'s outstanding on-base skills (as indicated by his high walk totals and other offensive statistics) are well documented, further supporting the reliability of this information.\"}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",

Task outcome (short version):\\nReggie Jackson led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks, and he had 525 at bats that season.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nAfter consulting the official MLB.com 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics page, we examined the individual player stats. The stat table shows the key batting categories including games played (G), at bats (AB), runs (R), hits (H), doubles, triples, home runs (HR), RBIs, and bases on balls (BB or walks) among other metrics. For Reggie Jackson\u2019s row, the data indicates he played in 146 games with 525 at bats. His line then lists 93 runs, 150 hits, 39 doubles, 2 triples, 32 home runs, and 110 RBIs. Most notably, his bases on balls total is recorded as 74 \u2013 a figure higher than his teammates. For example, Thurman Munson\u2019s stats on the same page show 595 at bats but a lower walk total of 39. Thus, Reggie Jackson was the walk leader for the Yankees in 1977, and his season at bats total was 525.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nThe data was verified against an official MLB.com statistics page for the 1977 New York Yankees. MLB.com is a reputable and official source for MLB historical statistics, ensuring the accuracy of these figures. Reggie Jackson's outstanding on-base skills (as indicated by his high walk totals and other offensive statistics) are well documented, further supporting the reliability of this information.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"New task:\\\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nPlease search for the 1977 New York Yankees season batting statistics, specifically identifying the player who led the team in walks, and providing his season at bats total.

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nReggie Jackson led the 1977 New York Yankees in walks, and he had 525 at bats that season.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nAfter consulting the official MLB.com 1977 Yankees player hitting statistics page, we examined the individual player stats. The stat table shows the key batting categories including games played (G), at bats (AB), runs (R), hits (H), doubles, triples, home runs (HR), RBIs, and bases on balls (BB or walks) among other metrics. For Reggie Jackson\u2019s row, the data indicates he played in 146 games with 525 at bats. His line then lists 93 runs, 150 hits, 39 doubles, 2 triples, 32 home runs, and 110 RBIs. Most notably, his bases on balls total is recorded as 74 \u2013 a figure higher than his teammates. For example, Thurman Munson\u2019s stats on the same page show 595 at bats but a lower walk total of 39. Thus, Reggie Jackson was the walk leader for the Yankees in 1977, and his season at bats total was 525.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nThe data was verified against an official MLB.com statistics page for the 1977 New York Yankees. MLB.com is a reputable and official source for MLB historical statistics, ensuring the accuracy of these figures. Reggie Jackson\\'s outstanding on-base skills (as indicated by his high walk totals and other offensive statistics) are well documented, further supporting the reliability of this information.\"}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",
