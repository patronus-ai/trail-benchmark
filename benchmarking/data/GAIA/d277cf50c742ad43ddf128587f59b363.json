Task outcome (short version):\nThe original song was composed by Roger Miller.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nThe two animated videos \u2013 one featuring a rooster (as seen in the widely shared 'Robin Hood Rooster Song') and another featuring a dancing hamster (linked to the famous Hampsterdance meme) \u2013 are both derived from the same original composition. This original composition is the instrumental piece 'Whistle-Stop' from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated film Robin Hood. Although the two renditions play with different tempos and modify lyrics to suit their unique styles, both stem from the same source. \"Whistle-Stop\" is firmly identified as a creation of Roger Miller, whose work not only provided the musical foundation for the film\u2019s soundtrack but also later became the basis for various internet memes. This connection has been confirmed through multiple archival sources, meme history discussions, and music analyses that point out the adaptation of Miller's melody in these viral animations.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nOver time, the catchy tune originally by Roger Miller was reinterpreted in different ways \u2013 a rooster animates a version that plays on fans\u2019 nostalgic love for Disney\u2019s Robin Hood, while a hamster dance video transformed the melody (often sped up) into the viral Hampsterdance phenomenon. These adaptations underline the memorable quality of Miller\u2019s original composition and its impact on both classic animation and modern internet culture. The consistency of the musical motif across these varied interpretations reinforces the attribution to Roger Miller, whose creation continues to influence meme history and digital media.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease search for detailed information about a song that appears in two separate animated videos.

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nThe original song was composed by Roger Miller.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nThe two animated videos \u2013 one featuring a rooster (as seen in the widely shared \\\\\\'Robin Hood Rooster Song\\\\\\') and another featuring a dancing hamster (linked to the famous Hampsterdance meme) \u2013 are both derived from the same original composition. This original composition is the instrumental piece \\\\\\'Whistle-Stop\\\\\\' from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated film Robin Hood. Although the two renditions play with different tempos and modify lyrics to suit their unique styles, both stem from the same source. \"Whistle-Stop\" is firmly identified as a creation of Roger Miller, whose work not only provided the musical foundation for the film\u2019s soundtrack but also later became the basis for various internet memes. This connection has been confirmed through multiple archival sources, meme history discussions, and music analyses that point out the adaptation of Miller\\\\\\'s melody in these viral animations.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nOver time, the catchy tune originally by Roger Miller was reinterpreted in different ways \u2013 a rooster animates a version that plays on fans\u2019 nostalgic love for Disney\u2019s Robin Hood, while a hamster dance video transformed the melody (often sped up) into the viral Hampsterdance phenomenon. These adaptations underline the memorable quality of Miller\u2019s original composition and its impact on both classic animation and modern internet culture. The consistency of the musical motif across these varied interpretations reinforces the attribution to Roger Miller, whose creation continues to influence meme history and digital media.\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['statistics', 'zipfile', 'sympy', 'pandas', 'math', 'pubchempy', 'requests', 'yahoo_finance', 'json', 'csv', 're', 'time', 'PyPDF2', 'os', 'bs4', 'datetime', 'chess', 'random', 'pptx', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'pydub', 'stat', 'PIL', 'unicodedata', 'sklearn', 'queue', 'xml', 'collections', 'itertools', 'torch', 'io', 'numpy', 'scipy']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['statistics', 'zipfile', 'sympy', 'pandas', 'math', 'pubchempy', 'requests', 'yahoo_finance', 'json', 'csv', 're', 'time', 'PyPDF2', 'os', 'bs4', 'datetime', 'chess', 'random', 'pptx', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'pydub', 'stat', 'PIL', 'unicodedata', 'sklearn', 'queue', 'xml', 'collections', 'itertools', 'torch', 'io', 'numpy', 'scipy']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nThe two animated videos \u2013 one featuring a rooster (as seen in the widely shared 'Robin Hood Rooster Song') and another featuring a dancing hamster (linked to the famous Hampsterdance meme) \u2013 are both derived from the same original composition. This original composition is the instrumental piece 'Whistle-Stop' from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated film Robin Hood. Although the two renditions play with different tempos and modify lyrics to suit their unique styles, both stem from the same source. \"Whistle-Stop\" is firmly identified as a creation of Roger Miller, whose work not only provided the musical foundation for the film\u2019s soundtrack but also later became the basis for various internet memes. This connection has been confirmed through multiple archival sources, meme history discussions, and music analyses that point out the adaptation of Miller's melody in these viral animations.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nOver time, the catchy tune originally by Roger Miller was reinterpreted in different ways \u2013 a rooster animates a version that plays on fans\u2019 nostalgic love for Disney\u2019s Robin Hood, while a hamster dance video transformed the melody (often sped up) into the viral Hampsterdance phenomenon. These adaptations underline the memorable quality of Miller\u2019s original composition and its impact on both classic animation and modern internet culture. The consistency of the musical motif across these varied interpretations reinforces the attribution to Roger Miller, whose creation continues to influence meme history and digital media.",

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

This original composition is the instrumental piece 'Whistle-Stop' from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated film Robin Hood. Although the two renditions play with different tempos and modify lyrics to suit their unique styles, both stem from the same source. \\\"Whistle-Stop\\\" is firmly identified as a creation of Roger Miller, whose work not only provided the musical foundation for the film\u2019s soundtrack but also later became the basis for various internet memes. This connection has been confirmed through multiple archival sources, meme history discussions, and music analyses that point out the adaptation of Miller's melody in these viral animations.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nOver time, the catchy tune originally by Roger Miller was reinterpreted in different ways \u2013 a rooster animates a version that plays on fans\u2019 nostalgic love for Disney\u2019s Robin Hood, while a hamster dance video transformed the melody (often sped up) into the viral Hampsterdance phenomenon. These adaptations underline the memorable quality of Miller\u2019s original composition and its impact on both classic animation and modern internet culture.

This original composition is the instrumental piece 'Whistle-Stop' from Disney\\u2019s 1973 animated film Robin Hood. Although the two renditions play with different tempos and modify lyrics to suit their unique styles, both stem from the same source. \\\"Whistle-Stop\\\" is firmly identified as a creation of Roger Miller, whose work not only provided the musical foundation for the film\\u2019s soundtrack but also later became the basis for various internet memes. This connection has been confirmed through multiple archival sources, meme history discussions, and music analyses that point out the adaptation of Miller's melody in these viral animations.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nOver time, the catchy tune originally by Roger Miller was reinterpreted in different ways \\u2013 a rooster animates a version that plays on fans\\u2019 nostalgic love for Disney\\u2019s Robin Hood, while a hamster dance video transformed the melody (often sped up) into the viral Hampsterdance phenomenon. These adaptations underline the memorable quality of Miller\\u2019s original composition and its impact on both classic animation and modern internet culture.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence.

Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['statistics', 'zipfile', 'sympy', 'pandas', 'math', 'pubchempy', 'requests', 'yahoo_finance', 'json', 'csv', 're', 'time', 'PyPDF2', 'os', 'bs4', 'datetime', 'chess', 'random', 'pptx', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'pydub', 'stat', 'PIL', 'unicodedata', 'sklearn', 'queue', 'xml', 'collections', 'itertools', 'torch', 'io', 'numpy', 'scipy']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Task outcome (short version):\\nThe original song was composed by Roger Miller.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nThe two animated videos \u2013 one featuring a rooster (as seen in the widely shared 'Robin Hood Rooster Song') and another featuring a dancing hamster (linked to the famous Hampsterdance meme) \u2013 are both derived from the same original composition. This original composition is the instrumental piece 'Whistle-Stop' from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated film Robin Hood. Although the two renditions play with different tempos and modify lyrics to suit their unique styles, both stem from the same source. \\\"Whistle-Stop\\\" is firmly identified as a creation of Roger Miller, whose work not only provided the musical foundation for the film\u2019s soundtrack but also later became the basis for various internet memes. This connection has been confirmed through multiple archival sources, meme history discussions, and music analyses that point out the adaptation of Miller's melody in these viral animations.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nOver time, the catchy tune originally by Roger Miller was reinterpreted in different ways \u2013 a rooster animates a version that plays on fans\u2019 nostalgic love for Disney\u2019s Robin Hood, while a hamster dance video transformed the melody (often sped up) into the viral Hampsterdance phenomenon. These adaptations underline the memorable quality of Miller\u2019s original composition and its impact on both classic animation and modern internet culture. The consistency of the musical motif across these varied interpretations reinforces the attribution to Roger Miller, whose creation continues to influence meme history and digital media.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"New task:\\\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nPlease search for detailed information about a song that appears in two separate animated videos.

Task outcome (short version):\\\\\\\\nThe original song was composed by Roger Miller.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\\\\\nThe two animated videos \u2013 one featuring a rooster (as seen in the widely shared \\\\\\\\\\\\'Robin Hood Rooster Song\\\\\\\\\\\\') and another featuring a dancing hamster (linked to the famous Hampsterdance meme) \u2013 are both derived from the same original composition. This original composition is the instrumental piece \\\\\\\\\\\\'Whistle-Stop\\\\\\\\\\\\' from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated film Robin Hood. Although the two renditions play with different tempos and modify lyrics to suit their unique styles, both stem from the same source. \\\"Whistle-Stop\\\" is firmly identified as a creation of Roger Miller, whose work not only provided the musical foundation for the film\u2019s soundtrack but also later became the basis for various internet memes. This connection has been confirmed through multiple archival sources, meme history discussions, and music analyses that point out the adaptation of Miller\\\\\\\\\\\\'s melody in these viral animations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\\\\\nOver time, the catchy tune originally by Roger Miller was reinterpreted in different ways \u2013 a rooster animates a version that plays on fans\u2019 nostalgic love for Disney\u2019s Robin Hood, while a hamster dance video transformed the melody (often sped up) into the viral Hampsterdance phenomenon. These adaptations underline the memorable quality of Miller\u2019s original composition and its impact on both classic animation and modern internet culture. The consistency of the musical motif across these varied interpretations reinforces the attribution to Roger Miller, whose creation continues to influence meme history and digital media.\\\\'}}}]'}]\\n---\\n</summary_of_work>\"}]}], \"stop_sequences\": [\"<end_code>\", \"Observation:\"], \"grammar\": null, \"tools_to_call_from\": null, \"kwargs\": {}}",

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['statistics', 'zipfile', 'sympy', 'pandas', 'math', 'pubchempy', 'requests', 'yahoo_finance', 'json', 'csv', 're', 'time', 'PyPDF2', 'os', 'bs4', 'datetime', 'chess', 'random', 'pptx', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'pydub', 'stat', 'PIL', 'unicodedata', 'sklearn', 'queue', 'xml', 'collections', 'itertools', 'torch', 'io', 'numpy', 'scipy']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Task outcome (short version):\\nThe original song was composed by Roger Miller.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nThe two animated videos \u2013 one featuring a rooster (as seen in the widely shared 'Robin Hood Rooster Song') and another featuring a dancing hamster (linked to the famous Hampsterdance meme) \u2013 are both derived from the same original composition. This original composition is the instrumental piece 'Whistle-Stop' from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated film Robin Hood. Although the two renditions play with different tempos and modify lyrics to suit their unique styles, both stem from the same source. \\\"Whistle-Stop\\\" is firmly identified as a creation of Roger Miller, whose work not only provided the musical foundation for the film\u2019s soundtrack but also later became the basis for various internet memes. This connection has been confirmed through multiple archival sources, meme history discussions, and music analyses that point out the adaptation of Miller's melody in these viral animations.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nOver time, the catchy tune originally by Roger Miller was reinterpreted in different ways \u2013 a rooster animates a version that plays on fans\u2019 nostalgic love for Disney\u2019s Robin Hood, while a hamster dance video transformed the melody (often sped up) into the viral Hampsterdance phenomenon. These adaptations underline the memorable quality of Miller\u2019s original composition and its impact on both classic animation and modern internet culture. The consistency of the musical motif across these varied interpretations reinforces the attribution to Roger Miller, whose creation continues to influence meme history and digital media.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"New task:\\\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nPlease search for detailed information about a song that appears in two separate animated videos.

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nThe original song was composed by Roger Miller.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nThe two animated videos \u2013 one featuring a rooster (as seen in the widely shared \\\\\\'Robin Hood Rooster Song\\\\\\') and another featuring a dancing hamster (linked to the famous Hampsterdance meme) \u2013 are both derived from the same original composition. This original composition is the instrumental piece \\\\\\'Whistle-Stop\\\\\\' from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated film Robin Hood. Although the two renditions play with different tempos and modify lyrics to suit their unique styles, both stem from the same source. \"Whistle-Stop\" is firmly identified as a creation of Roger Miller, whose work not only provided the musical foundation for the film\u2019s soundtrack but also later became the basis for various internet memes. This connection has been confirmed through multiple archival sources, meme history discussions, and music analyses that point out the adaptation of Miller\\\\\\'s melody in these viral animations.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nOver time, the catchy tune originally by Roger Miller was reinterpreted in different ways \u2013 a rooster animates a version that plays on fans\u2019 nostalgic love for Disney\u2019s Robin Hood, while a hamster dance video transformed the melody (often sped up) into the viral Hampsterdance phenomenon. These adaptations underline the memorable quality of Miller\u2019s original composition and its impact on both classic animation and modern internet culture. The consistency of the musical motif across these varied interpretations reinforces the attribution to Roger Miller, whose creation continues to influence meme history and digital media.\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",
