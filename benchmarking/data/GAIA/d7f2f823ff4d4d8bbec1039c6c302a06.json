This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task concerns a fish species that became invasive when released by pet owners.  \n  Reasoning: The invasive nature of the species is due to pet releases rather than natural range expansion.  \n\u2022 The species was popularized as a pet by its role as the main character in the movie Finding Nemo.  \n  Reasoning: This identifies the species as a clownfish\u2014the character \u201cNemo\u201d is an iconic clownfish.  \n\u2022 The data source for the sightings is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).  \n  Reasoning: We must base our answer on information provided by USGS regarding nonnative occurrences of the species.  \n\u2022 The inquiry is time-bound: the records must be from before the year 2020.  \n  Reasoning: This temporal limit means we must consider only reports dated earlier than 2020.  \n\u2022 The required answer format is the five-digit zip codes corresponding to the places where the species was found.  \n  Reasoning: The answer must be strictly formatted as five-digit zip codes, separated by commas if more than one.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The exact species name and taxonomy of the clownfish in question.  \n  Reasoning: Although \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d points to a clownfish, verifying the official species name (typically Amphiprion ocellaris or a similar taxon) is needed.  \n  Where to look: A reliable source such as a marine species database or scientific literature; the task itself points to USGS records, so checking the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database is appropriate.\n\u2022 The USGS records for this clownfish species as a nonnative (invasive) species in the United States before 2020.  \n  Reasoning: To answer the question, we need to retrieve documented USGS occurrences of the species, including the locations (with zip codes) reported before 2020.  \n  Where to look: The USGS NAS database website (e.g., nas.er.usgs.gov) or any USGS published report that details these records.\n\u2022 The associated location data including five-digit zip codes for each sighting reported by the USGS.  \n  Reasoning: Since the answer must be represented as zip codes, it is necessary to verify whether the USGS report provides this information or whether we need to convert location data (such as exact addresses or city information) into zip codes.\n\u2022 The publication or data update dates for the records to confirm they are from before 2020.  \n  Reasoning: Ensuring the records meet the time criteria is essential to satisfy the task\u2019s requirement.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the list of zip codes corresponding to the locations where the clownfish was reported by the USGS as nonnative before 2020.  \n  Reasoning: Once the USGS records have been examined and the location information determined, the specific five-digit zip codes need to be extracted and compiled.\n\u2022 If multiple records are found, derive the correctly formatted answer by listing the zip codes separated by commas.  \n  Reasoning: The task specifies that if there is more than one location, the zip codes must be output as a comma-delimited list.\n\u2022 Verify through logical reasoning and cross-checks that the selected records and zip codes meet all criteria (species identification, time frame, and correct format).  \n  Reasoning: This verification ensures that the derived answer is complete and correct according to the task\u2019s demands.\n```\n\nNow begin!

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The task concerns a fish species that became invasive when released by pet owners.  \\n  Reasoning: The invasive nature of the species is due to pet releases rather than natural range expansion.  \\n\u2022 The species was popularized as a pet by its role as the main character in the movie Finding Nemo.  \\n  Reasoning: This identifies the species as a clownfish\u2014the character \u201cNemo\u201d is an iconic clownfish.  \\n\u2022 The data source for the sightings is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).  \\n  Reasoning: We must base our answer on information provided by USGS regarding nonnative occurrences of the species.  \\n\u2022 The inquiry is time-bound: the records must be from before the year 2020.  \\n  Reasoning: This temporal limit means we must consider only reports dated earlier than 2020.  \\n\u2022 The required answer format is the five-digit zip codes corresponding to the places where the species was found.  \\n  Reasoning: The answer must be strictly formatted as five-digit zip codes, separated by commas if more than one.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The exact species name and taxonomy of the clownfish in question.  \\n  Reasoning: Although \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d points to a clownfish, verifying the official species name (typically Amphiprion ocellaris or a similar taxon) is needed.  \\n  Where to look: A reliable source such as a marine species database or scientific literature; the task itself points to USGS records, so checking the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database is appropriate.\\n\u2022 The USGS records for this clownfish species as a nonnative (invasive) species in the United States before 2020.  \\n  Reasoning: To answer the question, we need to retrieve documented USGS occurrences of the species, including the locations (with zip codes) reported before 2020.  \\n  Where to look: The USGS NAS database website (e.g., nas.er.usgs.gov) or any USGS published report that details these records.\\n\u2022 The associated location data including five-digit zip codes for each sighting reported by the USGS.  \\n  Reasoning: Since the answer must be represented as zip codes, it is necessary to verify whether the USGS report provides this information or whether we need to convert location data (such as exact addresses or city information) into zip codes.\\n\u2022 The publication or data update dates for the records to confirm they are from before 2020.  \\n  Reasoning: Ensuring the records meet the time criteria is essential to satisfy the task\u2019s requirement.\\n\\n### 3.

IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.

Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6.

Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'bs4', 'yahoo_finance', 'zipfile', 'Bio', 'json', 'xml', 'csv', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'random', 'io', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'torch', 'math', 'requests', 'sympy', 'PIL', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'statistics', 'chess', 'pydub', 'queue', 'time', 'datetime', 'numpy', 'unicodedata', 'os', 're', 'collections', 'stat', 'PyPDF2']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The task concerns a fish species that became invasive when released by pet owners.  \\n  Reasoning: The invasive nature of the species is due to pet releases rather than natural range expansion.  \\n\u2022 The species was popularized as a pet by its role as the main character in the movie Finding Nemo.  \\n  Reasoning: This identifies the species as a clownfish\u2014the character \u201cNemo\u201d is an iconic clownfish.  \\n\u2022 The data source for the sightings is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).  \\n  Reasoning: We must base our answer on information provided by USGS regarding nonnative occurrences of the species.  \\n\u2022 The inquiry is time-bound: the records must be from before the year 2020.  \\n  Reasoning: This temporal limit means we must consider only reports dated earlier than 2020.  \\n\u2022 The required answer format is the five-digit zip codes corresponding to the places where the species was found.  \\n  Reasoning: The answer must be strictly formatted as five-digit zip codes, separated by commas if more than one.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The exact species name and taxonomy of the clownfish in question.  \\n  Reasoning: Although \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d points to a clownfish, verifying the official species name (typically Amphiprion ocellaris or a similar taxon) is needed.  \\n  Where to look: A reliable source such as a marine species database or scientific literature; the task itself points to USGS records, so checking the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database is appropriate.\\n\u2022 The USGS records for this clownfish species as a nonnative (invasive) species in the United States before 2020.  \\n  Reasoning: To answer the question, we need to retrieve documented USGS occurrences of the species, including the locations (with zip codes) reported before 2020.  \\n  Where to look: The USGS NAS database website (e.g., nas.er.usgs.gov) or any USGS published report that details these records.\\n\u2022 The associated location data including five-digit zip codes for each sighting reported by the USGS.  \\n  Reasoning: Since the answer must be represented as zip codes, it is necessary to verify whether the USGS report provides this information or whether we need to convert location data (such as exact addresses or city information) into zip codes.\\n\u2022 The publication or data update dates for the records to confirm they are from before 2020.  \\n  Reasoning: Ensuring the records meet the time criteria is essential to satisfy the task\u2019s requirement.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the list of zip codes corresponding to the locations where the clownfish was reported by the USGS as nonnative before 2020.  \\n  Reasoning: Once the USGS records have been examined and the location information determined, the specific five-digit zip codes need to be extracted and compiled.\\n\u2022 If multiple records are found, derive the correctly formatted answer by listing the zip codes separated by commas.  \\n  Reasoning: The task specifies that if there is more than one location, the zip codes must be output as a comma-delimited list.\\n\u2022 Verify through logical reasoning and cross-checks that the selected records and zip codes meet all criteria (species identification, time frame, and correct format).  \\n  Reasoning: This verification ensures that the derived answer is complete and correct according to the task\u2019s demands.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'bs4', 'yahoo_finance', 'zipfile', 'Bio', 'json', 'xml', 'csv', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'random', 'io', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'torch', 'math', 'requests', 'sympy', 'PIL', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'statistics', 'chess', 'pydub', 'queue', 'time', 'datetime', 'numpy', 'unicodedata', 'os', 're', 'collections', 'stat', 'PyPDF2']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task concerns a fish species that became invasive when released by pet owners.  \n  Reasoning: The invasive nature of the species is due to pet releases rather than natural range expansion.  \n\u2022 The species was popularized as a pet by its role as the main character in the movie Finding Nemo.  \n  Reasoning: This identifies the species as a clownfish\u2014the character \u201cNemo\u201d is an iconic clownfish.  \n\u2022 The data source for the sightings is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).  \n  Reasoning: We must base our answer on information provided by USGS regarding nonnative occurrences of the species.  \n\u2022 The inquiry is time-bound: the records must be from before the year 2020.  \n  Reasoning: This temporal limit means we must consider only reports dated earlier than 2020.  \n\u2022 The required answer format is the five-digit zip codes corresponding to the places where the species was found.  \n  Reasoning: The answer must be strictly formatted as five-digit zip codes, separated by commas if more than one.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The exact species name and taxonomy of the clownfish in question.  \n  Reasoning: Although \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d points to a clownfish, verifying the official species name (typically Amphiprion ocellaris or a similar taxon) is needed.  \n  Where to look: A reliable source such as a marine species database or scientific literature; the task itself points to USGS records, so checking the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database is appropriate.\n\u2022 The USGS records for this clownfish species as a nonnative (invasive) species in the United States before 2020.  \n  Reasoning: To answer the question, we need to retrieve documented USGS occurrences of the species, including the locations (with zip codes) reported before 2020.  \n  Where to look: The USGS NAS database website (e.g., nas.er.usgs.gov) or any USGS published report that details these records.\n\u2022 The associated location data including five-digit zip codes for each sighting reported by the USGS.  \n  Reasoning: Since the answer must be represented as zip codes, it is necessary to verify whether the USGS report provides this information or whether we need to convert location data (such as exact addresses or city information) into zip codes.\n\u2022 The publication or data update dates for the records to confirm they are from before 2020.  \n  Reasoning: Ensuring the records meet the time criteria is essential to satisfy the task\u2019s requirement.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the list of zip codes corresponding to the locations where the clownfish was reported by the USGS as nonnative before 2020.  \n  Reasoning: Once the USGS records have been examined and the location information determined, the specific five-digit zip codes need to be extracted and compiled.\n\u2022 If multiple records are found, derive the correctly formatted answer by listing the zip codes separated by commas.  \n  Reasoning: The task specifies that if there is more than one location, the zip codes must be output as a comma-delimited list.\n\u2022 Verify through logical reasoning and cross-checks that the selected records and zip codes meet all criteria (species identification, time frame, and correct format).  \n  Reasoning: This verification ensures that the derived answer is complete and correct according to the task\u2019s demands.\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The task concerns a fish species that became invasive when released by pet owners.  \\n  Reasoning: The invasive nature of the species is due to pet releases rather than natural range expansion.  \\n\u2022 The species was popularized as a pet by its role as the main character in the movie Finding Nemo.  \\n  Reasoning: This identifies the species as a clownfish\u2014the character \u201cNemo\u201d is an iconic clownfish.  \\n\u2022 The data source for the sightings is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).  \\n  Reasoning: We must base our answer on information provided by USGS regarding nonnative occurrences of the species.  \\n\u2022 The inquiry is time-bound: the records must be from before the year 2020.  \\n  Reasoning: This temporal limit means we must consider only reports dated earlier than 2020.  \\n\u2022 The required answer format is the five-digit zip codes corresponding to the places where the species was found.  \\n  Reasoning: The answer must be strictly formatted as five-digit zip codes, separated by commas if more than one.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The exact species name and taxonomy of the clownfish in question.  \\n  Reasoning: Although \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d points to a clownfish, verifying the official species name (typically Amphiprion ocellaris or a similar taxon) is needed.  \\n  Where to look: A reliable source such as a marine species database or scientific literature; the task itself points to USGS records, so checking the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database is appropriate.\\n\u2022 The USGS records for this clownfish species as a nonnative (invasive) species in the United States before 2020.  \\n  Reasoning: To answer the question, we need to retrieve documented USGS occurrences of the species, including the locations (with zip codes) reported before 2020.  \\n  Where to look: The USGS NAS database website (e.g., nas.er.usgs.gov) or any USGS published report that details these records.\\n\u2022 The associated location data including five-digit zip codes for each sighting reported by the USGS.  \\n  Reasoning: Since the answer must be represented as zip codes, it is necessary to verify whether the USGS report provides this information or whether we need to convert location data (such as exact addresses or city information) into zip codes.\\n\u2022 The publication or data update dates for the records to confirm they are from before 2020.  \\n  Reasoning: Ensuring the records meet the time criteria is essential to satisfy the task\u2019s requirement.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the list of zip codes corresponding to the locations where the clownfish was reported by the USGS as nonnative before 2020.  \\n  Reasoning: Once the USGS records have been examined and the location information determined, the specific five-digit zip codes need to be extracted and compiled.\\n\u2022 If multiple records are found, derive the correctly formatted answer by listing the zip codes separated by commas.  \\n  Reasoning: The task specifies that if there is more than one location, the zip codes must be output as a comma-delimited list.\\n\u2022 Verify through logical reasoning and cross-checks that the selected records and zip codes meet all criteria (species identification, time frame, and correct format).  \\n  Reasoning: This verification ensures that the derived answer is complete and correct according to the task\u2019s demands.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_2', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'python_interpreter', 'arguments': '# First, I request our search_agent to look up the relevant USGS record.\\\\ntask_text = (\\\\n    \\\"Please search for the USGS record on nonnative occurrences of the pet clownfish \\\"\\\\n    \\\"(the species popularized by the movie Finding Nemo) that were reported before the year 2020. \\\"\\\\n    \\\"I need to know the location details as given in the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database, \\\"\\\\n    \\\"in particular the five\u2010digit zip codes of the reported sightings.\\\"\\\\n)\\\\nprint(task_text)\\\\n# (Assuming our team member returns a result.)'}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_2\\nObservation:\\nExecution logs:\\nPlease search for the USGS record on nonnative occurrences of the pet clownfish (the species popularized by the movie Finding Nemo) that were reported before the year 2020.

I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.\n\nTo output the final answer, use the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]\nYour FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your FINAL ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and DO NOT INCLUDE UNITS such as $ or USD or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, output 'FINAL ANSWER: Unable to determine'\n",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task concerns a fish species that became invasive when released by pet owners.  \n  Reasoning: The invasive nature of the species is due to pet releases rather than natural range expansion.  \n\u2022 The species was popularized as a pet by its role as the main character in the movie Finding Nemo.  \n  Reasoning: This identifies the species as a clownfish\u2014the character \u201cNemo\u201d is an iconic clownfish.  \n\u2022 The data source for the sightings is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).  \n  Reasoning: We must base our answer on information provided by USGS regarding nonnative occurrences of the species.  \n\u2022 The inquiry is time-bound: the records must be from before the year 2020.  \n  Reasoning: This temporal limit means we must consider only reports dated earlier than 2020.  \n\u2022 The required answer format is the five-digit zip codes corresponding to the places where the species was found.  \n  Reasoning: The answer must be strictly formatted as five-digit zip codes, separated by commas if more than one.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The exact species name and taxonomy of the clownfish in question.  \n  Reasoning: Although \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d points to a clownfish, verifying the official species name (typically Amphiprion ocellaris or a similar taxon) is needed.  \n  Where to look: A reliable source such as a marine species database or scientific literature; the task itself points to USGS records, so checking the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database is appropriate.\n\u2022 The USGS records for this clownfish species as a nonnative (invasive) species in the United States before 2020.  \n  Reasoning: To answer the question, we need to retrieve documented USGS occurrences of the species, including the locations (with zip codes) reported before 2020.  \n  Where to look: The USGS NAS database website (e.g., nas.er.usgs.gov) or any USGS published report that details these records.\n\u2022 The associated location data including five-digit zip codes for each sighting reported by the USGS.  \n  Reasoning: Since the answer must be represented as zip codes, it is necessary to verify whether the USGS report provides this information or whether we need to convert location data (such as exact addresses or city information) into zip codes.\n\u2022 The publication or data update dates for the records to confirm they are from before 2020.  \n  Reasoning: Ensuring the records meet the time criteria is essential to satisfy the task\u2019s requirement.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the list of zip codes corresponding to the locations where the clownfish was reported by the USGS as nonnative before 2020.  \n  Reasoning: Once the USGS records have been examined and the location information determined, the specific five-digit zip codes need to be extracted and compiled.\n\u2022 If multiple records are found, derive the correctly formatted answer by listing the zip codes separated by commas.  \n  Reasoning: The task specifies that if there is more than one location, the zip codes must be output as a comma-delimited list.\n\u2022 Verify through logical reasoning and cross-checks that the selected records and zip codes meet all criteria (species identification, time frame, and correct format).  \n  Reasoning: This verification ensures that the derived answer is complete and correct according to the task\u2019s demands.\n```",
