And also some of you might want to brush up on the last page in the integration section, page 197. I know some of you struggled on last week's quiz. I foresee problem 22 from page 197 being on your midterm. Oh, and don't forget to brush up on the section on related rates, on pages 132, 133, and 134.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the converted audio, recording each instance of page numbers: 245, 197, 197, 132, 133, 134\nStep 4: Sort the page numbers in ascending order, omitting duplicates, and store this list as the correct answer to my user's request: 132, 133, 134, 197, 245\nStep 5: Report the correct response to my user: \"132, 133, 134, 197, 245\"",

And please provide the list in ascending order.\n\nTo solve the task above, you will have to use this attached file: - Attached audio: data/gaia/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3\n```\nYou can leverage these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n- The task is to extract the page numbers for reading from an audio recording given by Professor Willowbrook.  \n  Reasoning: The recording contains the professor\u2019s recommended reading for a Calculus mid-term.\n- The output format requires the page numbers to be provided as a comma-delimited list in ascending order.  \n  Reasoning: This format instruction explicitly dictates how the answer should be formatted.\n- An attached audio file is provided with the path: data/gaia/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3 (identified in the task as Homework.mp3).  \n  Reasoning: The task relies on this attached file for extracting the required page numbers.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n- The actual content of the attached audio file (data/gaia/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3), specifically the segment where the professor announces the page numbers.  \n  Reasoning: The correct page numbers can only be obtained by listening to this recording.\n- Any context or additional reference that might be provided within the audio regarding the ordering or formatting of the numbers (if not clear, clarification of the instructions within the audio).  \n  Reasoning: It\u2019s important to verify if the numbers need any transformation (e.g., if they are mentioned in another order or include extra text) to ensure they are outputted as a comma-delimited ascending list.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n- From the audio, the specific page numbers that the professor indicates for the mid-term reading.  \n  Reasoning: We must listen to and transcribe or interpret the spoken content to extract these numeric values.\n- A final list of page numbers in ascending order, formatted exactly as a comma-delimited list.  \n  Reasoning: After extracting the numbers, they need to be sorted (if they are not already in order) and formatted according to the instructions.\n- Verification steps to ensure that the extraction is complete and correct (including re-listening to the audio if needed).  \n  Reasoning: It\u2019s crucial to double-check the extracted information to guarantee the answer meets the correctness criteria stated in the task.\n```\n\nNow begin!

Facts to look up\\n- The actual content of the attached audio file (data/gaia/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3), specifically the segment where the professor announces the page numbers.  \\n  Reasoning: The correct page numbers can only be obtained by listening to this recording.\\n- Any context or additional reference that might be provided within the audio regarding the ordering or formatting of the numbers (if not clear, clarification of the instructions within the audio).  \\n  Reasoning: It\u2019s important to verify if the numbers need any transformation (e.g., if they are mentioned in another order or include extra text) to ensure they are outputted as a comma-delimited ascending list.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n- From the audio, the specific page numbers that the professor indicates for the mid-term reading.  \\n  Reasoning: We must listen to and transcribe or interpret the spoken content to extract these numeric values.\\n- A final list of page numbers in ascending order, formatted exactly as a comma-delimited list.  \\n  Reasoning: After extracting the numbers, they need to be sorted (if they are not already in order) and formatted according to the instructions.\\n- Verification steps to ensure that the extraction is complete and correct (including re-listening to the audio if needed).  \\n  Reasoning: It\u2019s crucial to double-check the extracted information to guarantee the answer meets the correctness criteria stated in the task.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n- The task is to extract the page numbers for reading from an audio recording given by Professor Willowbrook.  \n  Reasoning: The recording contains the professor\u2019s recommended reading for a Calculus mid-term.\n- The output format requires the page numbers to be provided as a comma-delimited list in ascending order.  \n  Reasoning: This format instruction explicitly dictates how the answer should be formatted.\n- An attached audio file is provided with the path: data/gaia/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3 (identified in the task as Homework.mp3).  \n  Reasoning: The task relies on this attached file for extracting the required page numbers.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n- The actual content of the attached audio file (data/gaia/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3), specifically the segment where the professor announces the page numbers.  \n  Reasoning: The correct page numbers can only be obtained by listening to this recording.\n- Any context or additional reference that might be provided within the audio regarding the ordering or formatting of the numbers (if not clear, clarification of the instructions within the audio).  \n  Reasoning: It\u2019s important to verify if the numbers need any transformation (e.g., if they are mentioned in another order or include extra text) to ensure they are outputted as a comma-delimited ascending list.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n- From the audio, the specific page numbers that the professor indicates for the mid-term reading.  \n  Reasoning: We must listen to and transcribe or interpret the spoken content to extract these numeric values.\n- A final list of page numbers in ascending order, formatted exactly as a comma-delimited list.  \n  Reasoning: After extracting the numbers, they need to be sorted (if they are not already in order) and formatted according to the instructions.\n- Verification steps to ensure that the extraction is complete and correct (including re-listening to the audio if needed).  \n  Reasoning: It\u2019s crucial to double-check the extracted information to guarantee the answer meets the correctness criteria stated in the task.\n```",

Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\nYou can leverage these tools:\n- web_search: Perform a web search query (think a google search) and returns the search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The web search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"[Optional parameter]: filter the search results to only include pages from a specific year. For example, '2020' will only include pages from 2020. Make sure to use this parameter if you're trying to search for articles from a specific date!\", 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_page: Visit a webpage at a given URL and return its text. Given a url to a YouTube video, this returns the transcript.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The relative or absolute url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_up: Scroll the viewport UP one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_down: Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_on_page_ctrl_f: Scroll the viewport to the first occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for. Give this date in the format 'YYYYMMDD', for instance '27 June 2008' is written as '20080627'.\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n- The agent's name is \"search_agent\".\n- The task originates from the manager.\n- There is an attached audio file located at data/gaia/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3.\n- The audio file is a recording of Professor Willowbrook.\n- The content of the audio is the recommended reading for the Calculus mid-term.\n- The required action is to transcribe the recording and extract the page numbers mentioned in the recording.\n- The final output should be a comma-delimited list of the extracted page numbers arranged in ascending order.\n- The final answer must include three parts: a short version (Task outcome), an extremely detailed version, and any additional context.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n- The content of the audio file: Access the file at data/gaia/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3 to obtain the transcription.\n  \u2022 The extraction of the page numbers can only be confirmed after transcribing the audio.\n- Potential context regarding the professor or the materials (if necessary), though the main focus is solely on the transcription and page numbers.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n- The transcription of the audio must be carefully analyzed to identify all the page numbers mentioned by Professor Willowbrook.\n  \u2022 This requires reading through the transcription and noting any numerical references that represent page numbers.\n- A comma-delimited list of the extracted page numbers must be created.\n  \u2022 The list has to be arranged in ascending order.\n- The final answer structure must include:\n  \u2022 Task outcome (short version)\n  \u2022 Task outcome (extremely detailed version)\n  \u2022 Additional context (if relevant)\n- Logical reasoning must be applied to determine which numbers in the transcription are page numbers pertinent to the study material.\n```\n\nNow begin!

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n- The agent's name is \"search_agent\".\n- The task originates from the manager.\n- There is an attached audio file located at data/gaia/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3.\n- The audio file is a recording of Professor Willowbrook.\n- The content of the audio is the recommended reading for the Calculus mid-term.\n- The required action is to transcribe the recording and extract the page numbers mentioned in the recording.\n- The final output should be a comma-delimited list of the extracted page numbers arranged in ascending order.\n- The final answer must include three parts: a short version (Task outcome), an extremely detailed version, and any additional context.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n- The content of the audio file: Access the file at data/gaia/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3 to obtain the transcription.\n  \u2022 The extraction of the page numbers can only be confirmed after transcribing the audio.\n- Potential context regarding the professor or the materials (if necessary), though the main focus is solely on the transcription and page numbers.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n- The transcription of the audio must be carefully analyzed to identify all the page numbers mentioned by Professor Willowbrook.\n  \u2022 This requires reading through the transcription and noting any numerical references that represent page numbers.\n- A comma-delimited list of the extracted page numbers must be created.\n  \u2022 The list has to be arranged in ascending order.\n- The final answer structure must include:\n  \u2022 Task outcome (short version)\n  \u2022 Task outcome (extremely detailed version)\n  \u2022 Additional context (if relevant)\n- Logical reasoning must be applied to determine which numbers in the transcription are page numbers pertinent to the study material.\n```",

Extract the page numbers from the transcription, ensuring only the relevant numbers intended for the calculus mid-term reading material are captured.\n4. Convert the extracted page numbers into a comma-delimited list and sort them in ascending order.\n5. Compose the final answer, ensuring it has three parts: (a) a short version of the task outcome (listing just the comma-delimited page numbers), (b) an extremely detailed version explaining the transcription, extraction, and sorting process, and (c) any additional context that may be relevant to understanding the answer.\n6.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['re', 'pandas', 'io', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 'scipy', 'torch', 'datetime', 'bs4', 'pptx', 'fractions', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'sklearn', 'json', 'pubchempy', 'statistics', 'xml', 'collections', 'PIL', 'os', 'time', 'sympy', 'requests', 'numpy', 'unicodedata', 'itertools', 'zipfile', 'csv', 'PyPDF2', 'queue', 'math', 'stat', 'random']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['re', 'pandas', 'io', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 'scipy', 'torch', 'datetime', 'bs4', 'pptx', 'fractions', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'sklearn', 'json', 'pubchempy', 'statistics', 'xml', 'collections', 'PIL', 'os', 'time', 'sympy', 'requests', 'numpy', 'unicodedata', 'itertools', 'zipfile', 'csv', 'PyPDF2', 'queue', 'math', 'stat', 'random']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts to look up\n- The actual content of the attached audio file (data/gaia/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3), specifically the segment where the professor announces the page numbers.  \n  Reasoning: The correct page numbers can only be obtained by listening to this recording.\n- Any context or additional reference that might be provided within the audio regarding the ordering or formatting of the numbers (if not clear, clarification of the instructions within the audio).  \n  Reasoning: It\u2019s important to verify if the numbers need any transformation (e.g., if they are mentioned in another order or include extra text) to ensure they are outputted as a comma-delimited ascending list.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n- From the audio, the specific page numbers that the professor indicates for the mid-term reading.  \n  Reasoning: We must listen to and transcribe or interpret the spoken content to extract these numeric values.\n- A final list of page numbers in ascending order, formatted exactly as a comma-delimited list.  \n  Reasoning: After extracting the numbers, they need to be sorted (if they are not already in order) and formatted according to the instructions.\n- Verification steps to ensure that the extraction is complete and correct (including re-listening to the audio if needed).  \n  Reasoning: It\u2019s crucial to double-check the extracted information to guarantee the answer meets the correctness criteria stated in the task.\n```",

My friend from class sent me an audio recording of Professor Willowbrook giving out the recommended reading for the test, but my headphones are broken :(\n\nCould you please listen to the recording for me and tell me the page numbers I'm supposed to go over? I've attached a file called Homework.mp3 that has the recording. Please provide just the page numbers as a comma-delimited list.

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, output 'FINAL ANSWER: Unable to determine'\n",
