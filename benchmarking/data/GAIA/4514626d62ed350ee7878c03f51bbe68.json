Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The function is f(x) = x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2 \u2013 3x + 8.  \\n  Reasoning: This explicit formula for f(x) is essential since Newton\u2019s method requires evaluating both the function and its derivative at given x-values.  \\n\\n\u2022 The initial guess is x\u2080 = \u20135.  \\n  Reasoning: The starting point for Newton\u2019s method is provided, so we know where to begin the iterations.  \\n\\n\u2022 The iterative procedure specified is \u201cNewton\u2019s Method\u201d with an instruction to update the iteration with \u201cn = n + 1\u201d and to round the approximation to four decimal places at each step.  \\n  Reasoning: This indicates that we must repeatedly compute the next approximation using the Newton iteration formula and round the results at each iteration.  \\n\\n\u2022 The task is to determine the smallest n (i.e. the smallest number of iterations) where the result (after rounding to four decimal places) meets the convergence requirement implied by the procedure.  \\n  Reasoning: The problem asks for the count of iterations required for the method to converge (as measured by the rounded values).\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The Newton\u2019s Method formula.  \\n  Where to find: Standard calculus textbooks or trusted online resources such as Khan Academy or Wikipedia.  \\n  Reasoning: While the formula is well known (x\u2099\u208a\u2081 = x\u2099 \u2013 f(x\u2099)/f\u2009\u2032(x\u2099)), it is essential to ensure we are applying the method correctly.\\n\\n\u2022 The derivative of the function f(x).  \\n  Where to find: This can be computed directly using calculus rules, but if needed one might use a derivative calculator or reference website like WolframAlpha.  \\n  Reasoning: The derivative is required for the Newton iteration, so verifying its correct form (f\u2009\u2032(x)) is necessary.\\n\\n\u2022 Rounding rules to four decimal places.  \\n  Where to find: Common programming language documentation or mathematical reference sites regarding numerical rounding.  \\n  Reasoning: It is crucial to know exactly how rounding should be applied at each iteration to correctly determine when convergence is achieved.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The derivative f\u2009\u2032(x) from the given function.  \\n  Reasoning: Deriving f\u2009\u2032(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 8x \u2013 3 by applying standard differentiation rules is needed to set up the Newton\u2019s method iteration.\\n\\n\u2022 The iterative sequence using Newton\u2019s method.  \\n  Reasoning: Starting from x\u2080 = \u20135, we must compute x\u2081, x\u2082, \u2026 using the formula x\u2099\u208a\u2081 = x\u2099 \u2013 f(x\u2099)/f\u2009\u2032(x\u2099), applying the specific function and its derivative.  \\n\\n\u2022 The rounded values of each iteration to four decimal places.  \\n  Reasoning: After each Newton iteration, the result must be rounded to four decimals, and the iteration is considered \u201cstable\u201d when two successive rounded values are identical. Hence, computation/simulation is needed until this convergence is observed.\\n\\n\u2022 The minimum iteration count n (the smallest n) at which the rounded value remains unchanged.  \\n  Reasoning: By comparing the rounded results from consecutive iterations, we identify the first index n for which the convergence criterion is met.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The function is f(x) = x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2 \u2013 3x + 8.  \n  Reasoning: This explicit formula for f(x) is essential since Newton\u2019s method requires evaluating both the function and its derivative at given x-values.  \n\n\u2022 The initial guess is x\u2080 = \u20135.  \n  Reasoning: The starting point for Newton\u2019s method is provided, so we know where to begin the iterations.  \n\n\u2022 The iterative procedure specified is \u201cNewton\u2019s Method\u201d with an instruction to update the iteration with \u201cn = n + 1\u201d and to round the approximation to four decimal places at each step.  \n  Reasoning: This indicates that we must repeatedly compute the next approximation using the Newton iteration formula and round the results at each iteration.  \n\n\u2022 The task is to determine the smallest n (i.e. the smallest number of iterations) where the result (after rounding to four decimal places) meets the convergence requirement implied by the procedure.  \n  Reasoning: The problem asks for the count of iterations required for the method to converge (as measured by the rounded values).\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The Newton\u2019s Method formula.  \n  Where to find: Standard calculus textbooks or trusted online resources such as Khan Academy or Wikipedia.  \n  Reasoning: While the formula is well known (x\u2099\u208a\u2081 = x\u2099 \u2013 f(x\u2099)/f\u2009\u2032(x\u2099)), it is essential to ensure we are applying the method correctly.\n\n\u2022 The derivative of the function f(x).  \n  Where to find: This can be computed directly using calculus rules, but if needed one might use a derivative calculator or reference website like WolframAlpha.  \n  Reasoning: The derivative is required for the Newton iteration, so verifying its correct form (f\u2009\u2032(x)) is necessary.\n\n\u2022 Rounding rules to four decimal places.  \n  Where to find: Common programming language documentation or mathematical reference sites regarding numerical rounding.  \n  Reasoning: It is crucial to know exactly how rounding should be applied at each iteration to correctly determine when convergence is achieved.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The derivative f\u2009\u2032(x) from the given function.  \n  Reasoning: Deriving f\u2009\u2032(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 8x \u2013 3 by applying standard differentiation rules is needed to set up the Newton\u2019s method iteration.\n\n\u2022 The iterative sequence using Newton\u2019s method.  \n  Reasoning: Starting from x\u2080 = \u20135, we must compute x\u2081, x\u2082, \u2026 using the formula x\u2099\u208a\u2081 = x\u2099 \u2013 f(x\u2099)/f\u2009\u2032(x\u2099), applying the specific function and its derivative.  \n\n\u2022 The rounded values of each iteration to four decimal places.  \n  Reasoning: After each Newton iteration, the result must be rounded to four decimals, and the iteration is considered \u201cstable\u201d when two successive rounded values are identical. Hence, computation/simulation is needed until this convergence is observed.\n\n\u2022 The minimum iteration count n (the smallest n) at which the rounded value remains unchanged.  \n  Reasoning: By comparing the rounded results from consecutive iterations, we identify the first index n for which the convergence criterion is met. This requires step\u2010by\u2010step calculations or simulation of the iterative process.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The function is f(x) = x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2 \u2013 3x + 8.  \\n  Reasoning: This explicit formula for f(x) is essential since Newton\u2019s method requires evaluating both the function and its derivative at given x-values.  \\n\\n\u2022 The initial guess is x\u2080 = \u20135.  \\n  Reasoning: The starting point for Newton\u2019s method is provided, so we know where to begin the iterations.  \\n\\n\u2022 The iterative procedure specified is \u201cNewton\u2019s Method\u201d with an instruction to update the iteration with \u201cn = n + 1\u201d and to round the approximation to four decimal places at each step.  \\n  Reasoning: This indicates that we must repeatedly compute the next approximation using the Newton iteration formula and round the results at each iteration.  \\n\\n\u2022 The task is to determine the smallest n (i.e. the smallest number of iterations) where the result (after rounding to four decimal places) meets the convergence requirement implied by the procedure.  \\n  Reasoning: The problem asks for the count of iterations required for the method to converge (as measured by the rounded values).\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The Newton\u2019s Method formula.  \\n  Where to find: Standard calculus textbooks or trusted online resources such as Khan Academy or Wikipedia.  \\n  Reasoning: While the formula is well known (x\u2099\u208a\u2081 = x\u2099 \u2013 f(x\u2099)/f\u2009\u2032(x\u2099)), it is essential to ensure we are applying the method correctly.\\n\\n\u2022 The derivative of the function f(x).  \\n  Where to find: This can be computed directly using calculus rules, but if needed one might use a derivative calculator or reference website like WolframAlpha.  \\n  Reasoning: The derivative is required for the Newton iteration, so verifying its correct form (f\u2009\u2032(x)) is necessary.\\n\\n\u2022 Rounding rules to four decimal places.  \\n  Where to find: Common programming language documentation or mathematical reference sites regarding numerical rounding.  \\n  Reasoning: It is crucial to know exactly how rounding should be applied at each iteration to correctly determine when convergence is achieved.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The derivative f\u2009\u2032(x) from the given function.  \\n  Reasoning: Deriving f\u2009\u2032(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 8x \u2013 3 by applying standard differentiation rules is needed to set up the Newton\u2019s method iteration.\\n\\n\u2022 The iterative sequence using Newton\u2019s method.  \\n  Reasoning: Starting from x\u2080 = \u20135, we must compute x\u2081, x\u2082, \u2026 using the formula x\u2099\u208a\u2081 = x\u2099 \u2013 f(x\u2099)/f\u2009\u2032(x\u2099), applying the specific function and its derivative.  \\n\\n\u2022 The rounded values of each iteration to four decimal places.  \\n  Reasoning: After each Newton iteration, the result must be rounded to four decimals, and the iteration is considered \u201cstable\u201d when two successive rounded values are identical. Hence, computation/simulation is needed until this convergence is observed.\\n\\n\u2022 The minimum iteration count n (the smallest n) at which the rounded value remains unchanged.  \\n  Reasoning: By comparing the rounded results from consecutive iterations, we identify the first index n for which the convergence criterion is met.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 're', 'time', 'Bio', 'itertools', 'pptx', 'PIL', 'bs4', 'zipfile', 'queue', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'random', 'torch', 'sympy', 'requests', 'json', 'unicodedata', 'pydub', 'csv', 'numpy', 'sklearn', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'PyPDF2', 'statistics', 'math', 'xml', 'stat', 'chess', 'collections', 'datetime', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The function is f(x) = x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2 \u2013 3x + 8.  \n  Reasoning: This explicit formula for f(x) is essential since Newton\u2019s method requires evaluating both the function and its derivative at given x-values.  \n\n\u2022 The initial guess is x\u2080 = \u20135.  \n  Reasoning: The starting point for Newton\u2019s method is provided, so we know where to begin the iterations.  \n\n\u2022 The iterative procedure specified is \u201cNewton\u2019s Method\u201d with an instruction to update the iteration with \u201cn = n + 1\u201d and to round the approximation to four decimal places at each step.  \n  Reasoning: This indicates that we must repeatedly compute the next approximation using the Newton iteration formula and round the results at each iteration.  \n\n\u2022 The task is to determine the smallest n (i.e. the smallest number of iterations) where the result (after rounding to four decimal places) meets the convergence requirement implied by the procedure.  \n  Reasoning: The problem asks for the count of iterations required for the method to converge (as measured by the rounded values).\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The Newton\u2019s Method formula.  \n  Where to find: Standard calculus textbooks or trusted online resources such as Khan Academy or Wikipedia.  \n  Reasoning: While the formula is well known (x\u2099\u208a\u2081 = x\u2099 \u2013 f(x\u2099)/f\u2009\u2032(x\u2099)), it is essential to ensure we are applying the method correctly.\n\n\u2022 The derivative of the function f(x).  \n  Where to find: This can be computed directly using calculus rules, but if needed one might use a derivative calculator or reference website like WolframAlpha.  \n  Reasoning: The derivative is required for the Newton iteration, so verifying its correct form (f\u2009\u2032(x)) is necessary.\n\n\u2022 Rounding rules to four decimal places.  \n  Where to find: Common programming language documentation or mathematical reference sites regarding numerical rounding.  \n  Reasoning: It is crucial to know exactly how rounding should be applied at each iteration to correctly determine when convergence is achieved.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The derivative f\u2009\u2032(x) from the given function.  \n  Reasoning: Deriving f\u2009\u2032(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 8x \u2013 3 by applying standard differentiation rules is needed to set up the Newton\u2019s method iteration.\n\n\u2022 The iterative sequence using Newton\u2019s method.  \n  Reasoning: Starting from x\u2080 = \u20135, we must compute x\u2081, x\u2082, \u2026 using the formula x\u2099\u208a\u2081 = x\u2099 \u2013 f(x\u2099)/f\u2009\u2032(x\u2099), applying the specific function and its derivative.  \n\n\u2022 The rounded values of each iteration to four decimal places.  \n  Reasoning: After each Newton iteration, the result must be rounded to four decimals, and the iteration is considered \u201cstable\u201d when two successive rounded values are identical. Hence, computation/simulation is needed until this convergence is observed.\n\n\u2022 The minimum iteration count n (the smallest n) at which the rounded value remains unchanged.  \n  Reasoning: By comparing the rounded results from consecutive iterations, we identify the first index n for which the convergence criterion is met. This requires step\u2010by\u2010step calculations or simulation of the iterative process.\n\n\n```",

Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded.\nRun verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer!\nHere is the task:\nGiven $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?\n\nTo output the final answer, use the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]\nYour FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your FINAL ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and DO NOT INCLUDE UNITS such as $ or USD or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, output 'FINAL ANSWER: Unable to determine'\n",
