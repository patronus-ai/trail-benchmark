Facts to derive\n\u2022 Calculate the ratio between the sea star\u2019s measured size (from the 2002 paper) and the harlequin shrimp\u2019s total length (from the 2017 paper).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: Once both numerical values are known, derive the percentage by dividing the sea star\u2019s measurement by the total shrimp length and multiplying by 100.  \n\u2022 Round the resulting percentage to the nearest integer.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: The final answer should be the integer-rounded percentage as specified in the task.\n```\n\nNow begin!

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['bs4', 'chess', 'torch', 'random', 'sympy', 'fractions', 'statistics', 'itertools', 'io', 'pptx', 'time', 'pandas', 'datetime', 'queue', 'numpy', 'unicodedata', 'zipfile', 'PIL', 'yahoo_finance', 're', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'stat', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'math', 'requests', 'os', 'csv', 'pydub', 'json', 'PyPDF2', 'Bio', 'xml']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['bs4', 'chess', 'torch', 'random', 'sympy', 'fractions', 'statistics', 'itertools', 'io', 'pptx', 'time', 'pandas', 'datetime', 'queue', 'numpy', 'unicodedata', 'zipfile', 'PIL', 'yahoo_finance', 're', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'stat', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'math', 'requests', 'os', 'csv', 'pydub', 'json', 'PyPDF2', 'Bio', 'xml']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Curt Fiedler (2002).  \n\u2022 The 2017 paper contains a recorded total length measurement for the harlequin shrimp.  \n\u2022 The 2002 paper specifies the size of a sea star fed to the same type of shrimp, given as a measurement relative to the shrimp\u2019s total length.  \n\u2022 The question asks for the integer-rounded percentage of the shrimp\u2019s total length that the sea star represents.  \n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full bibliographic details and, most importantly, the numerical value for the harlequin shrimp\u2019s total length as recorded in Omar Valencfia-Mendez\u2019s 2017 paper.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Source: The actual paper (or reliable academic databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, or the journal\u2019s website).  \n\u2022 The exact measurement or percentage (or the raw data that allows computation) for the size of the sea star fed to the shrimp from G. Curt Fiedler\u2019s 2002 paper.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Source: The paper itself via academic databases or the journal\u2019s repository.  \n\u2022 Verification of units if any conversion is needed (for example, if the two papers use different measurement units).  \n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Calculate the ratio between the sea star\u2019s measured size (from the 2002 paper) and the harlequin shrimp\u2019s total length (from the 2017 paper).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: Once both numerical values are known, derive the percentage by dividing the sea star\u2019s measurement by the total shrimp length and multiplying by 100.  \n\u2022 Round the resulting percentage to the nearest integer.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: The final answer should be the integer-rounded percentage as specified in the task.\n```",

Curt Fiedler\u2019s 2002 paper.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Source: The paper itself via academic databases or the journal\u2019s repository.  \n\u2022 Verification of units if any conversion is needed (for example, if the two papers use different measurement units).  \n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Calculate the ratio between the sea star\u2019s measured size (from the 2002 paper) and the harlequin shrimp\u2019s total length (from the 2017 paper).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: Once both numerical values are known, derive the percentage by dividing the sea star\u2019s measurement by the total shrimp length and multiplying by 100.  \n\u2022 Round the resulting percentage to the nearest integer.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: The final answer should be the integer-rounded percentage as specified in the task.\n```",

Formulate a clear understanding of the two papers: Omar Valencfia-Mendez (2017) for the recorded total length of the harlequin shrimp and G. Curt Fiedler (2002) for the measurement (or relative size) of the sea star fed to the shrimp.\n2. Use available research tools (e.g., search_agent) to locate and access the bibliographic information and, if possible, full texts of both papers to extract the exact measurements.\n3. Extract the numerical value for the shrimp\u2019s total length from the 2017 paper; verify the unit of measurement.\n4. Extract the corresponding measurement for the sea star from the 2002 paper. Confirm if the measurement is provided as an absolute value (requiring a computation of its proportion relative to the shrimp\u2019s total length) or directly as a percentage.\n5. If necessary, perform any unit conversions to ensure both measurements are comparable.\n6. Calculate the ratio of the sea star\u2019s measured size to the shrimp\u2019s total length, and then multiply by 100 to determine the percentage.\n7. Round the computed percentage to the nearest integer.\n8. Run verification steps to ensure the extraction and calculation are accurate.\n9. Provide the final integer-rounded percentage as the answer using the final_answer tool.\n\n\n```",

Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['bs4', 'chess', 'torch', 'random', 'sympy', 'fractions', 'statistics', 'itertools', 'io', 'pptx', 'time', 'pandas', 'datetime', 'queue', 'numpy', 'unicodedata', 'zipfile', 'PIL', 'yahoo_finance', 're', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'stat', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'math', 'requests', 'os', 'csv', 'pydub', 'json', 'PyPDF2', 'Bio', 'xml']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['bs4', 'chess', 'torch', 'random', 'sympy', 'fractions', 'statistics', 'itertools', 'io', 'pptx', 'time', 'pandas', 'datetime', 'queue', 'numpy', 'unicodedata', 'zipfile', 'PIL', 'yahoo_finance', 're', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'stat', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'math', 'requests', 'os', 'csv', 'pydub', 'json', 'PyPDF2', 'Bio', 'xml']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Curt Fiedler (2002).  \n\u2022 The 2017 paper contains a recorded total length measurement for the harlequin shrimp.  \n\u2022 The 2002 paper specifies the size of a sea star fed to the same type of shrimp, given as a measurement relative to the shrimp\u2019s total length.  \n\u2022 The question asks for the integer-rounded percentage of the shrimp\u2019s total length that the sea star represents.  \n\n### 2.

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The task refers to two research papers: one by Omar Valencfia-Mendez (2017) and another by G. Curt Fiedler (2002).  \\n\u2022 The 2017 paper contains a recorded total length measurement for the harlequin shrimp.  \\n\u2022 The 2002 paper specifies the size of a sea star fed to the same type of shrimp, given as a measurement relative to the shrimp\u2019s total length.  \\n\u2022 The question asks for the integer-rounded percentage of the shrimp\u2019s total length that the sea star represents.  \\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full bibliographic details and, most importantly, the numerical value for the harlequin shrimp\u2019s total length as recorded in Omar Valencfia-Mendez\u2019s 2017 paper.  \\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Source: The actual paper (or reliable academic databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, or the journal\u2019s website).  \\n\u2022 The exact measurement or percentage (or the raw data that allows computation) for the size of the sea star fed to the shrimp from G. Curt Fiedler\u2019s 2002 paper.  \\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Source: The paper itself via academic databases or the journal\u2019s repository.  \\n\u2022 Verification of units if any conversion is needed (for example, if the two papers use different measurement units).  \\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Calculate the ratio between the sea star\u2019s measured size (from the 2002 paper) and the harlequin shrimp\u2019s total length (from the 2017 paper).  \\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: Once both numerical values are known, derive the percentage by dividing the sea star\u2019s measurement by the total shrimp length and multiplying by 100.  \\n\u2022 Round the resulting percentage to the nearest integer.  \\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: The final answer should be the integer-rounded percentage as specified in the task.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_2', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'python_interpreter', 'arguments': 'task = (\\\\n    \\\"Hello search_agent, please help me gather the following information: \\\"\\\\n    \\\"1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task refers to two research papers: one by Omar Valencfia-Mendez (2017) and another by G. Curt Fiedler (2002).  \n\u2022 The 2017 paper contains a recorded total length measurement for the harlequin shrimp.  \n\u2022 The 2002 paper specifies the size of a sea star fed to the same type of shrimp, given as a measurement relative to the shrimp\u2019s total length.  \n\u2022 The question asks for the integer-rounded percentage of the shrimp\u2019s total length that the sea star represents.  \n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full bibliographic details and, most importantly, the numerical value for the harlequin shrimp\u2019s total length as recorded in Omar Valencfia-Mendez\u2019s 2017 paper.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Source: The actual paper (or reliable academic databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, or the journal\u2019s website).  \n\u2022 The exact measurement or percentage (or the raw data that allows computation) for the size of the sea star fed to the shrimp from G. Curt Fiedler\u2019s 2002 paper.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Source: The paper itself via academic databases or the journal\u2019s repository.  \n\u2022 Verification of units if any conversion is needed (for example, if the two papers use different measurement units).  \n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Calculate the ratio between the sea star\u2019s measured size (from the 2002 paper) and the harlequin shrimp\u2019s total length (from the 2017 paper).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: Once both numerical values are known, derive the percentage by dividing the sea star\u2019s measurement by the total shrimp length and multiplying by 100.  \n\u2022 Round the resulting percentage to the nearest integer.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: The final answer should be the integer-rounded percentage as specified in the task.\n```",
