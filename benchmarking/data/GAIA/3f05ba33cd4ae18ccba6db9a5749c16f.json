Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store.

Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The complete grocery list is provided: milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts.  \n\u2022 The task specifically asks for creating a list that contains only the vegetables from the grocery list.  \n\u2022 The vegetables must be listed in alphabetical order in a comma-separated format.  \n\u2022 There is an explicit instruction that no botanical fruits are allowed to be included in the vegetable list because the categorization must be botanically accurate.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Botanical definitions and classifications for specific items on the list. For example:  \n\u2003\u2013 How items like green beans, bell pepper, zucchini, and corn are classified botanically (i.e. whether they are considered fruits rather than vegetables).  \n\u2003\u2013 The botanical status of fresh basil (herb) versus common vegetables.  \n\u2003\u2013 Any official botanical resource or trusted source such as academic textbooks or reputable websites (e.g., Wikipedia, university extension pages) may be referenced for these classifications.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Identify which items from the list are botanically considered vegetables (as opposed to fruits, nuts, grains, or herbs).  \n\u2003\u2013 For example, derive that sweet potatoes, broccoli, celery, and lettuce are vegetables.  \n\u2022 Exclude those items that, despite common culinary classification, are botanical fruits (such as green beans, bell pepper, zucchini, corn, and whole allspice) as well as any other non-vegetable items like dairy, eggs, baked goods, and spices.  \n\u2022 Alphabetize the final derived list of vegetables and format them as a comma-separated list.\n```\n\nNow begin!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
