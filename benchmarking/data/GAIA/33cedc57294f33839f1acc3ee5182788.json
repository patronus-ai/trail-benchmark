The abstract includes the key excerpt: \"Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered.\" This excerpt unambiguously states that the beads are at least 142 thousand years old.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe study offers important insights into early symbolic behavior among Homo sapiens in North Africa. By analyzing shell beads made from Tritia gibbosula (previously known as Mediterranean Nassa gibbosula), the research connects the British Museum object to broader discussions on early personal ornamentation and cultural continuity during the Middle Stone Age. The age attribution of 142 thousand years pushes back the timeline for the emergence of such symbolic behavior in the region.\n",

Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The object in the British Museum\u2019s collection with the museum number 2012,5015.17 is the shell of a particular mollusk species.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The task explicitly identifies the museum number and that it is a mollusk shell.  \n\u2022 A research article was published in Science Advances in 2021 whose abstract mentions that beads made from the shells of this mollusk species were found.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The task states that the abstract of that article provides age information for the beads.  \n\u2022 The key question is: according to that abstract, those beads are at least how many thousands of years old?  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The goal is to extract this specific age value from the cited article abstract.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The detailed record for the British Museum object with museum number 2012,5015.17 (to confirm the mollusk species and any additional context).  \n\u2003 Where to look: The British Museum\u2019s online collection database.  \n\u2022 The full abstract (or article) from Science Advances 2021 that discusses the beads made from this mollusk shell, with particular attention to the reported age of the beads.  \n\u2003 Where to look: Science Advances\u2019 website or scholarly databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar) using keywords like \u201cScience Advances 2021 mollusk shell beads\u201d and the article title if available.  \n\u2022 Verification of the dating method and numerical expression in the abstract to ensure that the value (expressed in thousands of years) is correctly interpreted.  \n\u2003 Where to look: The supplementary materials or referenced dating literature within the article if needed.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the specific numerical age (in thousands of years) from the abstract of the referenced Science Advances article.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: By reading and interpreting the abstract, we can extract the statement indicating that the beads are \u201cat least X thousands of years old.\u201d  \n\u2022 From the retrieved abstract, confirm whether any additional qualifiers affect the interpretation of the age (such as \u201cminimum\u201d or \u201capproximately\u201d).  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Logical reasoning must be applied to ensure that the extracted number is used in the correct context (i.e., \u201cat least\u201d meaning a minimum age threshold).  \n\u2022 Compile and verify the final numeric answer by possibly cross-checking with the British Museum record and the article to ensure consistency and correctness.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Running verification steps ensures that the derived answer adheres to the task requirement of being correct.\n```\n\nNow begin!

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\"sec1\"><h2 class=\"pmc_sec_title\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\"#R1\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R1\"><em>1</em></a>).

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'io', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'pubchempy', 'itertools', 'json', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'collections', 'math', 'queue', 'unicodedata', 'time', 'sympy', 're', 'stat', 'os', 'requests', 'random', 'statistics', 'fractions', 'chess', 'xml', 'csv', 'PIL', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'numpy']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'io', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'pubchempy', 'itertools', 'json', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'collections', 'math', 'queue', 'unicodedata', 'time', 'sympy', 're', 'stat', 'os', 'requests', 'random', 'statistics', 'fractions', 'chess', 'xml', 'csv', 'PIL', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'numpy']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The object in the British Museum\u2019s collection with the museum number 2012,5015.17 is the shell of a particular mollusk species.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The task explicitly identifies the museum number and that it is a mollusk shell.  \n\u2022 A research article was published in Science Advances in 2021 whose abstract mentions that beads made from the shells of this mollusk species were found.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The task states that the abstract of that article provides age information for the beads.  \n\u2022 The key question is: according to that abstract, those beads are at least how many thousands of years old?  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The goal is to extract this specific age value from the cited article abstract.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The detailed record for the British Museum object with museum number 2012,5015.17 (to confirm the mollusk species and any additional context).  \n\u2003 Where to look: The British Museum\u2019s online collection database.  \n\u2022 The full abstract (or article) from Science Advances 2021 that discusses the beads made from this mollusk shell, with particular attention to the reported age of the beads.  \n\u2003 Where to look: Science Advances\u2019 website or scholarly databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar) using keywords like \u201cScience Advances 2021 mollusk shell beads\u201d and the article title if available.  \n\u2022 Verification of the dating method and numerical expression in the abstract to ensure that the value (expressed in thousands of years) is correctly interpreted.  \n\u2003 Where to look: The supplementary materials or referenced dating literature within the article if needed.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the specific numerical age (in thousands of years) from the abstract of the referenced Science Advances article.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: By reading and interpreting the abstract, we can extract the statement indicating that the beads are \u201cat least X thousands of years old.\u201d  \n\u2022 From the retrieved abstract, confirm whether any additional qualifiers affect the interpretation of the age (such as \u201cminimum\u201d or \u201capproximately\u201d).  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Logical reasoning must be applied to ensure that the extracted number is used in the correct context (i.e., \u201cat least\u201d meaning a minimum age threshold).  \n\u2022 Compile and verify the final numeric answer by possibly cross-checking with the British Museum record and the article to ensure consistency and correctness.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Running verification steps ensures that the derived answer adheres to the task requirement of being correct.\n```",

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nThe relevant research article, \u201cEarly Middle Stone Age personal ornaments from Bizmoune Cave, Essaouira, Morocco\u201d published in Science Advances in 2021, reports on shell beads made from the marine gastropod species Tritia gibbosula \u2013 which corresponds to the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17. The abstract includes the following key excerpt: \"Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered.\" This clearly indicates that the beads are at least 142 thousand years old.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe study offers important insights into early symbolic behavior among Homo sapiens in North Africa, with these beads representing some of the earliest known personal ornaments. The identification of the mollusk as Tritia gibbosula (formerly referenced as Mediterranean Nassa gibbosula) ties directly to the British Museum object, ensuring that the research is discussing the same material culture. This evidence significantly contributes to our understanding of Middle Stone Age behavioral complexity.",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \\n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \\n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \\n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \\n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \\n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \\n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \\n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \\n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\\\"at least [X] thousand years old\\\") of the shell beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \\n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \\\"at least 45 thousand years old\\\" if that is what is stated).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\"at least [X] thousand years old\") of the shell beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \"at least 45 thousand years old\" if that is what is stated).  \n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\n\n\n```",

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \\n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \\n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \\n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\\\"at least [X] thousand years old\\\") of the shell beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \\n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \\\"at least 45 thousand years old\\\" if that is what is stated).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\"at least [X] thousand years old\") of the shell beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \"at least 45 thousand years old\" if that is what is stated).  \n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \\n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \\n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \\n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \\n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \\n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \\n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \\n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \\n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\\\"at least [X] thousand years old\\\") of the shell beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \\n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \\\"at least 45 thousand years old\\\" if that is what is stated).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\"at least [X] thousand years old\") of the shell beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \"at least 45 thousand years old\" if that is what is stated).  \n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \\n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \\n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \\n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \\n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \\n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \\n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \\n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \\n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\\\"at least [X] thousand years old\\\") of the shell beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \\n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \\\"at least 45 thousand years old\\\" if that is what is stated).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\"at least [X] thousand years old\") of the shell beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \"at least 45 thousand years old\" if that is what is stated).  \n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\n\n\n```",

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \\n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \\n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \\n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\\\"at least [X] thousand years old\\\") of the shell beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \\n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \\\"at least 45 thousand years old\\\" if that is what is stated).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\"at least [X] thousand years old\") of the shell beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \"at least 45 thousand years old\" if that is what is stated).  \n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \\n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \\n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \\n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \\n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \\n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \\n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \\n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \\n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\\\"at least [X] thousand years old\\\") of the shell beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \\n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \\\"at least 45 thousand years old\\\" if that is what is stated).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Perform a web search query (think a google search) and returns the search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The web search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"[Optional parameter]: filter the search results to only include pages from a specific year.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\"at least [X] thousand years old\") of the shell beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \"at least 45 thousand years old\" if that is what is stated).  \n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\n\n\n```",

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\"sec1\"><h2 class=\"pmc_sec_title\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\"#R1\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R1\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\"#R2\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R2\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\"#R3\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R3\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\"#R4\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R4\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\"#R5\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R5\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\"#R6\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R6\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\"#R8\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R8\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\"#R9\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R9\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\"#R11\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R11\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\"#R12\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R12\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\"#R13\" class=\"usa-link\"",

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \\n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \\n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \\n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\\\"at least [X] thousand years old\\\") of the shell beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \\n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \\\"at least 45 thousand years old\\\" if that is what is stated).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\"at least [X] thousand years old\") of the shell beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \"at least 45 thousand years old\" if that is what is stated).  \n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\n\n\n```",

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\"sec1\"><h2 class=\"pmc_sec_title\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\"#R1\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R1\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\"#R2\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R2\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\"#R3\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R3\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\"#R4\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R4\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\"#R5\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R5\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\"#R6\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R6\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\"#R8\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R8\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\"#R9\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R9\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\"#R11\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R11\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\"#R12\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R12\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\"#R13\" class=\"usa-link\" ",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \\n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \\n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \\n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \\n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \\n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \\n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \\n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \\n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\\\"at least [X] thousand years old\\\") of the shell beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \\n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \\\"at least 45 thousand years old\\\" if that is what is stated).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\\\"sec1\\\"><h2 class=\\\"pmc_sec_title\\\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\\\"#R1\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R1\\\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\\\"#R2\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R2\\\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\\\"#R3\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R3\\\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\\\"#R4\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R4\\\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\\\"#R5\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R5\\\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\\\"#R6\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R6\\\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\\\"#R8\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R8\\\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\\\"#R9\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R9\\\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\\\"#R11\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R11\\\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\\\"#R12\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R12\\\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\\\"#R13\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Earlier we've built a list of facts.\\nBut since in your previous steps you may have learned useful new facts or invalidated some false ones.\\nPlease update your list of facts based on the previous history, and provide these headings:\\n### 1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\"at least [X] thousand years old\") of the shell beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \"at least 45 thousand years old\" if that is what is stated).  \n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\n\n\n```",

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\"sec1\"><h2 class=\"pmc_sec_title\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\"#R1\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R1\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\"#R2\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R2\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\"#R3\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R3\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\"#R4\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R4\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\"#R5\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R5\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\"#R6\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R6\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\"#R8\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R8\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\"#R9\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R9\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\"#R11\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R11\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\"#R12\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R12\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\"#R13\" class=\"usa-link\"",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \\n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \\n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \\n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \\n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \\n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \\n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \\n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \\n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\\\"at least [X] thousand years old\\\") of the shell beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \\n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \\\"at least 45 thousand years old\\\" if that is what is stated).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\\\"sec1\\\"><h2 class=\\\"pmc_sec_title\\\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\\\"#R1\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R1\\\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\\\"#R2\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R2\\\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\\\"#R3\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R3\\\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\\\"#R4\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R4\\\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\\\"#R5\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R5\\\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\\\"#R6\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R6\\\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\\\"#R8\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R8\\\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\\\"#R9\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R9\\\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\\\"#R11\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R11\\\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\\\"#R12\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R12\\\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\\\"#R13\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You're still working towards solving this task:\\n```\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease locate and provide the relevant abstract (or the key excerpt from the abstract) of the Science Advances 2021 research article which reports on shell beads made from the mollusk species corresponding to the British Museum object with the museum number 2012,5015.17.

Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\"at least [X] thousand years old\") of the shell beads.  \n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \"at least 45 thousand years old\" if that is what is stated).  \n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\n\n\n```",

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\"sec1\"><h2 class=\"pmc_sec_title\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\"#R1\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R1\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\"#R2\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R2\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\"#R3\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R3\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\"#R4\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R4\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\"#R5\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R5\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\"#R6\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R6\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\"#R8\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R8\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\"#R9\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R9\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\"#R11\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R11\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\"#R12\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R12\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\"#R13\" class=\"usa-link\"",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The task is based on a Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The research article is published in 2021 in Science Advances, which sets the context and publication date.  \\n\u2022 The article reports on shell beads made from a mollusk species.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The subject matter is centered on shell beads derived from a specific mollusk species.  \\n\u2022 The mollusk species is determined by its correspondence with the British Museum object that has the museum number 2012,5015.17.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This museum number is used to precisely identify the mollusk species used in the study.  \\n\u2022 The abstract of the article includes a statement that the beads are at least a certain number of thousands of years old.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This is a key piece of data to extract\u2014the minimum age (in thousands of years) as mentioned in the abstract.  \\n\u2022 The final answer is expected to include three distinct parts:  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (short version)  \\n\u2003- Task outcome (extremely detailed version)  \\n\u2003- Additional context (if relevant)  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This structure is required to provide a comprehensive answer to the manager.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full reference and access details for the Science Advances 2021 research article.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: To locate the abstract, we need to know the exact article details possibly from a research database or the Science Advances website.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Science Advances website, academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science), or institutional access sites.  \\n\u2022 The exact abstract (or the relevant excerpt from it) of the article, particularly the portion that states the minimum age of the beads in thousands of years.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The abstract needs to be extracted in full (or at least the key excerpt) to answer the task accurately.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: Article PDF, online journal website, or the article\u2019s landing page on Science Advances.  \\n\u2022 Additional details about the British Museum object number 2012,5015.17, such as the mollusk species identification.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Confirming the species associated with this museum number may be necessary to ensure correct identification of the studied beads.  \\n\u2003Potential sources: British Museum online collection database or official British Museum publications.  \\n\u2022 The numerical value (in thousands of years) mentioned in the abstract for the minimum age of the beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: This specific number is a crucial part of the answer, and it must be extracted accurately from the abstract.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the correct extraction of the key excerpt from the abstract that specifically states the minimum age (\\\"at least [X] thousand years old\\\") of the shell beads.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: From the abstract, it is necessary to logically determine and isolate the statement regarding the beads' age.  \\n\u2022 Compute the relevance and context of the numerical value (e.g., ensuring it is expressed correctly and completely, such as \\\"at least 45 thousand years old\\\" if that is what is stated).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires clarity about the temporal extent of the beads.\\n\u2022 Infer and compile the overall information into the final answer format with the specified three parts (short version, extremely detailed version, additional context).  \\n\u2003Reasoning: Logical assembly of the pieces of information into a coherent final response that meets the task requirements.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\\\"sec1\\\"><h2 class=\\\"pmc_sec_title\\\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\\\"#R1\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R1\\\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\\\"#R2\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R2\\\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\\\"#R3\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R3\\\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\\\"#R4\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R4\\\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\\\"#R5\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R5\\\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\\\"#R6\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R6\\\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\\\"#R8\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R8\\\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\\\"#R9\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R9\\\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\\\"#R11\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R11\\\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\\\"#R12\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R12\\\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\\\"#R13\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\"\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[FACTS LIST]:\\nHere is the updated list of the facts that I know:\\n```\\nfinal_answer:\\n  1.

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\"sec1\"><h2 class=\"pmc_sec_title\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\"#R1\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R1\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\"#R2\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R2\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\"#R3\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R3\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\"#R4\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R4\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\"#R5\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R5\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\"#R6\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R6\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\"#R8\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R8\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\"#R9\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R9\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\"#R11\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R11\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\"#R12\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R12\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\"#R13\" class=\"usa-link\"",

Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'io', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'pubchempy', 'itertools', 'json', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'collections', 'math', 'queue', 'unicodedata', 'time', 'sympy', 're', 'stat', 'os', 'requests', 'random', 'statistics', 'fractions', 'chess', 'xml', 'csv', 'PIL', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'numpy']\\n9.

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\\\"sec1\\\"><h2 class=\\\"pmc_sec_title\\\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\\\\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\\\\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\\\"#R1\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R1\\\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\\\"#R2\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R2\\\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\\\"#R3\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R3\\\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\\\"#R4\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R4\\\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\\\"#R5\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R5\\\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\\\"#R6\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R6\\\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\\\\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\\\"#R8\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R8\\\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\\\"#R9\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R9\\\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\\\"#R11\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R11\\\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\\\"#R12\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R12\\\"><em>12</em></a>).

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'io', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'pubchempy', 'itertools', 'json', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'collections', 'math', 'queue', 'unicodedata', 'time', 'sympy', 're', 'stat', 'os', 'requests', 'random', 'statistics', 'fractions', 'chess', 'xml', 'csv', 'PIL', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'numpy']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Facts to look up\n\u2022 The detailed record for the British Museum object with museum number 2012,5015.17 (to confirm the mollusk species and any additional context).  \n\u2003 Where to look: The British Museum\u2019s online collection database.  \n\u2022 The full abstract (or article) from Science Advances 2021 that discusses the beads made from this mollusk shell, with particular attention to the reported age of the beads.  \n\u2003 Where to look: Science Advances\u2019 website or scholarly databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar) using keywords like \u201cScience Advances 2021 mollusk shell beads\u201d and the article title if available.  \n\u2022 Verification of the dating method and numerical expression in the abstract to ensure that the value (expressed in thousands of years) is correctly interpreted.  \n\u2003 Where to look: The supplementary materials or referenced dating literature within the article if needed.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the specific numerical age (in thousands of years) from the abstract of the referenced Science Advances article.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: By reading and interpreting the abstract, we can extract the statement indicating that the beads are \u201cat least X thousands of years old.\u201d  \n\u2022 From the retrieved abstract, confirm whether any additional qualifiers affect the interpretation of the age (such as \u201cminimum\u201d or \u201capproximately\u201d).  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Logical reasoning must be applied to ensure that the extracted number is used in the correct context (i.e., \u201cat least\u201d meaning a minimum age threshold).  \n\u2022 Compile and verify the final numeric answer by possibly cross-checking with the British Museum record and the article to ensure consistency and correctness.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Running verification steps ensures that the derived answer adheres to the task requirement of being correct.\n```",

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\"sec1\"><h2 class=\"pmc_sec_title\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\"#R1\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R1\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\"#R2\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R2\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\"#R3\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R3\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\"#R4\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R4\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\"#R5\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R5\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\"#R6\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R6\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\"#R8\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R8\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\"#R9\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R9\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\"#R11\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R11\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\"#R12\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R12\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\"#R13\" class=\"usa-link\"'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': '[FACTS LIST]:\\nHere is the updated list of the facts that I know:\\n```\\nfinal_answer:\\n  1.

The abstract includes the key excerpt: \"Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered.\" This excerpt unambiguously states that the beads are at least 142 thousand years old.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe study offers important insights into early symbolic behavior among Homo sapiens in North Africa. By analyzing shell beads made from Tritia gibbosula (previously known as Mediterranean Nassa gibbosula), the research connects the British Museum object to broader discussions on early personal ornamentation and cultural continuity during the Middle Stone Age. The age attribution of 142 thousand years pushes back the timeline for the emergence of such symbolic behavior in the region.\n",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'io', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'pubchempy', 'itertools', 'json', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'collections', 'math', 'queue', 'unicodedata', 'time', 'sympy', 're', 'stat', 'os', 'requests', 'random', 'statistics', 'fractions', 'chess', 'xml', 'csv', 'PIL', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'numpy']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\\\"sec1\\\"><h2 class=\\\"pmc_sec_title\\\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\\\\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\\\\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\\\"#R1\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R1\\\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\\\"#R2\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R2\\\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\\\"#R3\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R3\\\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\\\"#R4\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R4\\\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\\\"#R5\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R5\\\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\\\"#R6\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R6\\\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\\\\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\\\"#R8\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R8\\\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\\\"#R9\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R9\\\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\\\"#R11\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R11\\\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\\\"#R12\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R12\\\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\\\"#R13\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\"'}]\\n---\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': '[FACTS LIST]:\\\\nHere is the updated list of the facts that I know:\\\\n```\\\\nfinal_answer:\\\\n  1.

The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city} population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'io', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'pubchempy', 'itertools', 'json', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'collections', 'math', 'queue', 'unicodedata', 'time', 'sympy', 're', 'stat', 'os', 'requests', 'random', 'statistics', 'fractions', 'chess', 'xml', 'csv', 'PIL', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'numpy']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts to look up\n\u2022 The detailed record for the British Museum object with museum number 2012,5015.17 (to confirm the mollusk species and any additional context).  \n\u2003 Where to look: The British Museum\u2019s online collection database.  \n\u2022 The full abstract (or article) from Science Advances 2021 that discusses the beads made from this mollusk shell, with particular attention to the reported age of the beads.  \n\u2003 Where to look: Science Advances\u2019 website or scholarly databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar) using keywords like \u201cScience Advances 2021 mollusk shell beads\u201d and the article title if available.  \n\u2022 Verification of the dating method and numerical expression in the abstract to ensure that the value (expressed in thousands of years) is correctly interpreted.  \n\u2003 Where to look: The supplementary materials or referenced dating literature within the article if needed.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the specific numerical age (in thousands of years) from the abstract of the referenced Science Advances article.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: By reading and interpreting the abstract, we can extract the statement indicating that the beads are \u201cat least X thousands of years old.\u201d  \n\u2022 From the retrieved abstract, confirm whether any additional qualifiers affect the interpretation of the age (such as \u201cminimum\u201d or \u201capproximately\u201d).  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Logical reasoning must be applied to ensure that the extracted number is used in the correct context (i.e., \u201cat least\u201d meaning a minimum age threshold).  \n\u2022 Compile and verify the final numeric answer by possibly cross-checking with the British Museum record and the article to ensure consistency and correctness.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Running verification steps ensures that the derived answer adheres to the task requirement of being correct.\n```",

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\"sec1\"><h2 class=\"pmc_sec_title\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\"#R1\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R1\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\"#R2\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R2\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\"#R3\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R3\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\"#R4\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R4\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\"#R5\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R5\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\"#R6\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R6\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\"#R8\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R8\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\"#R9\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R9\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\"#R11\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R11\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\"#R12\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R12\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\"#R13\" class=\"usa-link\"'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': '[FACTS LIST]:\\nHere is the updated list of the facts that I know:\\n```\\nfinal_answer:\\n  1.

Facts still to look up:\\n     \u2022 Confirm additional details about the identification of the mollusk species to ensure that the Mediterranean Nassa gibbosula (or Tritia gibbosula) mentioned in the abstract is indeed the one corresponding to BM object 2012,5015.17.\\n     \u2022 Verify any supplementary context in the full text that might precisely link the BM object identification to the abstract excerpt.\\n     \u2022 Ensure that no other abstract or related study contradicts or refines the stated minimum age of the beads.\\n\\n  4. Facts still to derive:\\n     \u2022 Extract and clearly isolate the key excerpt from the abstract that states the age of the beads.\\n     \u2022 Derive the final answer in the required format with:\\n         - A short task outcome summarizing that the beads are at least 142 thousand years old,\\n         - An extremely detailed task outcome including the abstract excerpt and contextual details from the paper,\\n         - Additional context explaining the research article and the identification of the mollusk species.\\n     \u2022 Compile and format the final answer according to the three-part structure mandated by the task.\\n```'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Calling tools:\\n[{\\'id\\': \\'call_8SvzIYlkuCcBVWPIMY673OBT\\', \\'type\\': \\'function\\', \\'function\\': {\\'name\\': \\'final_answer\\', \\'arguments\\': {\\'answer\\': \\'### 1.

The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\\\\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\\\"#R1\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R1\\\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\\\"#R2\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R2\\\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\\\"#R3\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R3\\\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\\\"#R4\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R4\\\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\\\"#R5\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R5\\\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\\\"#R6\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R6\\\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\\\\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\\\"#R7\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R7\\\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\\\"#R8\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R8\\\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\\\"#R9\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R9\\\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\\\"#R10\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R10\\\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\\\"#R11\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R11\\\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\\\"#R12\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\" aria-describedby=\\\"R12\\\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\\\"#R13\\\" class=\\\"usa-link\\\"'}]\\n---\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': '[FACTS LIST]:\\\\nHere is the updated list of the facts that I know:\\\\n```\\\\nfinal_answer:\\\\n  1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The object in the British Museum\u2019s collection with the museum number 2012,5015.17 is the shell of a particular mollusk species.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The task explicitly identifies the museum number and that it is a mollusk shell.  \n\u2022 A research article was published in Science Advances in 2021 whose abstract mentions that beads made from the shells of this mollusk species were found.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The task states that the abstract of that article provides age information for the beads.  \n\u2022 The key question is: according to that abstract, those beads are at least how many thousands of years old?  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The goal is to extract this specific age value from the cited article abstract.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The detailed record for the British Museum object with museum number 2012,5015.17 (to confirm the mollusk species and any additional context).  \n\u2003 Where to look: The British Museum\u2019s online collection database.  \n\u2022 The full abstract (or article) from Science Advances 2021 that discusses the beads made from this mollusk shell, with particular attention to the reported age of the beads.  \n\u2003 Where to look: Science Advances\u2019 website or scholarly databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar) using keywords like \u201cScience Advances 2021 mollusk shell beads\u201d and the article title if available.  \n\u2022 Verification of the dating method and numerical expression in the abstract to ensure that the value (expressed in thousands of years) is correctly interpreted.  \n\u2003 Where to look: The supplementary materials or referenced dating literature within the article if needed.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the specific numerical age (in thousands of years) from the abstract of the referenced Science Advances article.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: By reading and interpreting the abstract, we can extract the statement indicating that the beads are \u201cat least X thousands of years old.\u201d  \n\u2022 From the retrieved abstract, confirm whether any additional qualifiers affect the interpretation of the age (such as \u201cminimum\u201d or \u201capproximately\u201d).  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Logical reasoning must be applied to ensure that the extracted number is used in the correct context (i.e., \u201cat least\u201d meaning a minimum age threshold).  \n\u2022 Compile and verify the final numeric answer by possibly cross-checking with the British Museum record and the article to ensure consistency and correctness.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Running verification steps ensures that the derived answer adheres to the task requirement of being correct.\n```",

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to \u2265142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity. The early and continued use of <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> and other material culture traits also suggest a remarkable degree of cultural continuity among early MSA <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups across North Africa.</p></section><section id=\"sec1\"><h2 class=\"pmc_sec_title\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\\n<p>Symbolic artifacts and other behavioral indicators of hominin cognitive complexity appear quite early within Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Middle Paleolithic contexts in North Africa, South Africa, and southwest Asia. The most common and earliest material indicators of symbolic behavior are beads and other personal ornaments, frequently made from marine shells.</p>\\n<p>Some of the earliest evidence for use of marine shells in symbolic contexts comes from the eastern Mediterranean Levant. In Qafzeh Cave, layers dating to ca. 100 thousand years (ka) yielded <em>Glycymeris insubrica</em> shells with natural perforations (<a href=\"#R1\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R1\"><em>1</em></a>). Clearer examples of shell beads were identified in Skhul Cave, on Mt. Carmel (<a href=\"#R2\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R2\"><em>2</em></a>). The age of these artifacts could be between 100 and 135 ka (<a href=\"#R3\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R3\"><em>3</em></a>). In South Africa, a large series of perforated <em>Nassarius kraussianus</em> shells from Blombos Cave (<a href=\"#R4\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R4\"><em>4</em></a>) is dated to be between ca. 76 and 100 ka (<a href=\"#R5\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R5\"><em>5</em></a>), while more varied assemblages of shell beads from the site of Sibudu date to somewhat later (<a href=\"#R6\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R6\"><em>6</em></a>).</p>\\n<p>In North Africa, <em>Tritia gibbosula</em> shell beads occur in many MSA sites (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>\u2013<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). A total of 33 perforated <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells have been recorded from a MSA/Aterian context at Grotte des Pigeons at Taforalt, with a most likely date of ~82.5 ka (<a href=\"#R7\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R7\"><em>7</em></a>). Excavations at Contrebandiers Cave (<a href=\"#R8\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R8\"><em>8</em></a>) identified a total of 151 shell beads in a context dated to ca. 115 \u00b1 3 ka (<a href=\"#R9\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R9\"><em>9</em></a>). At El Mnasra Cave, 234 <em>T. gibbosula</em> shells were collected from three MSA/Aterian layers (<a href=\"#R10\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R10\"><em>10</em></a>). The age of this context was estimated to span the period ~107 to ~112 ka (<a href=\"#R11\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R11\"><em>11</em></a>). At Ifri n\u2019Ammar, in Eastern Morocco, single perforated specimens of <em>Tritia</em> and <em>Columbella rustica</em> were found in an MSA/Aterian context dated to 83 ka (<a href=\"#R12\" class=\"usa-link\" aria-describedby=\"R12\"><em>12</em></a>). Another single perforated <em>Tritia</em> shell was identified in Oued Djebbana, Algeria (<a href=\"#R13\" class=\"usa-link\"'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': '[FACTS LIST]:\\nHere is the updated list of the facts that I know:\\n```\\nfinal_answer:\\n  1.
