Task outcome (short version):\nThe horror movie is \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nIn her contribution within the 2017 book World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries, Valentina Re examines how narrative techniques blur the boundaries between different layers of reality \u2013 in this case, a dream world colliding with the real world \u2013 a literary phenomenon known as metalepsis. In her analysis, she specifically cites the horror movie \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d as a seminal work that popularized this concept. She explains that the film\u2019s innovative narrative structure interweaves the liminal space of dreams with waking reality, thereby challenging the conventional separation between the two realms. This intermingling not only destabilizes the viewer\u2019s suspension of disbelief but also exemplifies how popular media can elevate formal narrative experiments into widely recognized tropes.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d has long been noted in academic discussions for its portrayal of a nightmarish world where the boundary between dream and reality is porous. Its impact on the horror genre and modern narrative strategies is often cited as a turning point in cinematic storytelling, making it a fitting reference in arguments about the construction of transmedia storyworlds and metafictional strategies.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease search for and locate Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book 'World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries'.

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \\n\\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Calling tools:\\n[{\\'id\\': \\'call_TIryzVN1Qf7ZQdz9X4Wj8YJW\\', \\'type\\': \\'function\\', \\'function\\': {\\'name\\': \\'web_search\\', \\'arguments\\': {\\'query\\': \\'Valentina Re contribution \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Call id: call_TIryzVN1Qf7ZQdz9X4Wj8YJW\\nObservation:\\nAddress: google: Valentina Re contribution \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\nTitle: Valentina Re contribution \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie - Search\\nViewport position: Showing page 1 of 1.\\n=======================\\nA Google search for \\'Valentina Re contribution \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\' found 8 results:\\n\\n## Web Results\\n1.

She explains that the film\u2019s innovative narrative structure interweaves the liminal space of dreams with waking reality, thereby challenging the conventional separation between the two realms. This intermingling not only destabilizes the viewer\u2019s suspension of disbelief but also exemplifies how popular media can elevate formal narrative experiments into widely recognized tropes.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\n\u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d has long been noted in academic discussions for its portrayal of a nightmarish world where the boundary between dream and reality is porous. Its impact on the horror genre and modern narrative strategies is often cited as a turning point in cinematic storytelling, making it a fitting reference in arguments about the construction of transmedia storyworlds and metafictional strategies.'}}}]\"}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['requests', 'numpy', 'zipfile', 'math', 're', 'io', 'time', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'yahoo_finance', 'pptx', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'pandas', 'stat', 'chess', 'random', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'csv', 'statistics', 'itertools', 'sympy', 'xml', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'PyPDF2', 'PIL', 'queue', 'datetime', 'os', 'pydub', 'torch']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['requests', 'numpy', 'zipfile', 'math', 're', 'io', 'time', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'yahoo_finance', 'pptx', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'pandas', 'stat', 'chess', 'random', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'csv', 'statistics', 'itertools', 'sympy', 'xml', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'PyPDF2', 'PIL', 'queue', 'datetime', 'os', 'pydub', 'torch']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nIn her contribution within the 2017 book World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries, Valentina Re examines how narrative techniques blur the boundaries between different layers of reality \u2013 in this case, a dream world colliding with the real world \u2013 a literary phenomenon known as metalepsis. In her analysis, she specifically cites the horror movie \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d as a seminal work that popularized this concept. She explains that the film\u2019s innovative narrative structure interweaves the liminal space of dreams with waking reality, thereby challenging the conventional separation between the two realms. This intermingling not only destabilizes the viewer\u2019s suspension of disbelief but also exemplifies how popular media can elevate formal narrative experiments into widely recognized tropes.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d has long been noted in academic discussions for its portrayal of a nightmarish world where the boundary between dream and reality is porous. Its impact on the horror genre and modern narrative strategies is often cited as a turning point in cinematic storytelling, making it a fitting reference in arguments about the construction of transmedia storyworlds and metafictional strategies.",

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\\n\\nNow begin!

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Perform a web search query (think a google search) and returns the search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The web search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"[Optional parameter]: filter the search results to only include pages from a specific year. For example, '2020' will only include pages from 2020. Make sure to use this parameter if you're trying to search for articles from a specific date!\", 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_page: Visit a webpage at a given URL and return its text. Given a url to a YouTube video, this returns the transcript.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The relative or absolute url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_up: Scroll the viewport UP one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_down: Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_on_page_ctrl_f: Scroll the viewport to the first occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for. Give this date in the format 'YYYYMMDD', for instance '27 June 2008' is written as '20080627'.\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Identify and navigate to the specific document or webpage that contains Valentina Re\u2019s contribution.\n3. Once the document is loaded, use the find_on_page function to search for keywords such as \"metalepsis,\" \"dream world,\" and \"reality\" to locate the relevant section.\n4. Carefully scroll through the identified section to find the sentence where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically where she cites the horror movie.\n5. Extract the complete and exact horror movie title as mentioned, along with any surrounding contextual sentences that support the identification.\n6.

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Use the web_search tool to locate digital versions or online references to Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries,\" aiming to find a searchable version of her text.\n2. Identify and navigate to the specific document or webpage that contains Valentina Re\u2019s contribution.\n3. Once the document is loaded, use the find_on_page function to search for keywords such as \"metalepsis,\" \"dream world,\" and \"reality\" to locate the relevant section.\n4. Carefully scroll through the identified section to find the sentence where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically where she cites the horror movie.\n5. Extract the complete and exact horror movie title as mentioned, along with any surrounding contextual sentences that support the identification.\n6. Compile and prepare the final answer ensuring it contains: \n   - A short version outcome.\n   - An extremely detailed version outcome with the full context.\n   - Additional context if relevant.\n\n\n```",

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Perform a web search query (think a google search) and returns the search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The web search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"[Optional parameter]: filter the search results to only include pages from a specific year. For example, '2020' will only include pages from 2020. Make sure to use this parameter if you're trying to search for articles from a specific date!\", 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_page: Visit a webpage at a given URL and return its text. Given a url to a YouTube video, this returns the transcript.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The relative or absolute url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_up: Scroll the viewport UP one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_down: Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_on_page_ctrl_f: Scroll the viewport to the first occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for. Give this date in the format 'YYYYMMDD', for instance '27 June 2008' is written as '20080627'.\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Use the web_search tool to locate digital versions or online references to Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries,\" aiming to find a searchable version of her text.\n2. Identify and navigate to the specific document or webpage that contains Valentina Re\u2019s contribution.\n3. Once the document is loaded, use the find_on_page function to search for keywords such as \"metalepsis,\" \"dream world,\" and \"reality\" to locate the relevant section.\n4. Carefully scroll through the identified section to find the sentence where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically where she cites the horror movie.\n5. Extract the complete and exact horror movie title as mentioned, along with any surrounding contextual sentences that support the identification.\n6. Compile and prepare the final answer ensuring it contains: \n   - A short version outcome.\n   - An extremely detailed version outcome with the full context.\n   - Additional context if relevant.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Use the web_search tool to locate digital versions or online references to Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries,\" aiming to find a searchable version of her text.\n2. Identify and navigate to the specific document or webpage that contains Valentina Re\u2019s contribution.\n3. Once the document is loaded, use the find_on_page function to search for keywords such as \"metalepsis,\" \"dream world,\" and \"reality\" to locate the relevant section.\n4. Carefully scroll through the identified section to find the sentence where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically where she cites the horror movie.\n5. Extract the complete and exact horror movie title as mentioned, along with any surrounding contextual sentences that support the identification.\n6.

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Use the web_search tool to locate digital versions or online references to Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries,\" aiming to find a searchable version of her text.\n2. Identify and navigate to the specific document or webpage that contains Valentina Re\u2019s contribution.\n3. Once the document is loaded, use the find_on_page function to search for keywords such as \"metalepsis,\" \"dream world,\" and \"reality\" to locate the relevant section.\n4. Carefully scroll through the identified section to find the sentence where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically where she cites the horror movie.\n5. Extract the complete and exact horror movie title as mentioned, along with any surrounding contextual sentences that support the identification.\n6. Compile and prepare the final answer ensuring it contains: \n   - A short version outcome.\n   - An extremely detailed version outcome with the full context.\n   - Additional context if relevant.\n\n\n```",

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d. Finally, we will analyze the breaking down of the fourth wall, the highest degree of metafiction that Supernatural has afforded itself, yet nothing like the aggressive reflexivity described by Wollen. Supernatural uses two strategies to achieve this effect: leeching the format in \u201cGhostfacers\u201d, where an enunciative device (televised fiction itself) feigns to be something different (a reality show); and the direct appeal to the audience in the extratextual coda in \u201cYellow Fever\u201d, in which Jensen Ackles parodies his own fictional character.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button\" data-signup-modal=\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Breaking the Mirror.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Verify that the Academia.edu document is indeed Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book by checking the title, publication details, and affiliation with the book\u2019s subject.\n2. Use the search function (e.g., find_on_page) within the document to locate keywords related to the required section, such as \"dream\" (or related terms like \"reality\" and \"metalepsis\") and \"horror\", to pinpoint the passage discussing the metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n3. Once the relevant section is found, carefully read through the text to identify the specific sentence or sentences where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.\n4. Extract the complete title of the horror movie exactly as it appears (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) along with a couple of surrounding sentences to provide context for the citation.\n5. Validate that the extracted movie title is linked to the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n6. Compile the final answer into the required format with a short outcome summary, an extremely detailed explanation including the extracted context, and any additional relevant context.\n\n\n```",

                                                                "llm.input_messages.2.message.content": "[FACTS LIST]:\nHere are the facts that I know so far:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Identify and navigate to the specific document or webpage that contains Valentina Re\u2019s contribution.\n3. Once the document is loaded, use the find_on_page function to search for keywords such as \"metalepsis,\" \"dream world,\" and \"reality\" to locate the relevant section.\n4.

Extract the complete and exact horror movie title as mentioned, along with any surrounding contextual sentences that support the identification.\n6.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d. Finally, we will analyze the breaking down of the fourth wall, the highest degree of metafiction that Supernatural has afforded itself, yet nothing like the aggressive reflexivity described by Wollen. Supernatural uses two strategies to achieve this effect: leeching the format in \u201cGhostfacers\u201d, where an enunciative device (televised fiction itself) feigns to be something different (a reality show); and the direct appeal to the audience in the extratextual coda in \u201cYellow Fever\u201d, in which Jensen Ackles parodies his own fictional character.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button\" data-signup-modal=\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Breaking the Mirror.

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d. Finally, we will analyze the breaking down of the fourth wall, the highest degree of metafiction that Supernatural has afforded itself, yet nothing like the aggressive reflexivity described by Wollen. Supernatural uses two strategies to achieve this effect: leeching the format in \u201cGhostfacers\u201d, where an enunciative device (televised fiction itself) feigns to be something different (a reality show); and the direct appeal to the audience in the extratextual coda in \u201cYellow Fever\u201d, in which Jensen Ackles parodies his own fictional character.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Breaking the Mirror.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline\"}]}], \"stop_sequences\": [\"Observation:\"], \"grammar\": null, \"tools_to_call_from\": [\"<scripts.text_web_browser.SearchInformationTool object at 0x12434a210>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.VisitTool object at 0x116ccd8d0>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.PageUpTool object at 0x12434a050>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.PageDownTool object at 0x120ab11d0>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.FinderTool object at 0x124367210>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.FindNextTool object at 0x1208fca10>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.ArchiveSearchTool object at 0x124364650>\", \"<scripts.text_inspector_tool.TextInspectorTool object at 0x120ab1050>\", \"<smolagents.default_tools.FinalAnswerTool object at 0x105838210>\"], \"kwargs\": {}}",

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d. Finally, we will analyze the breaking down of the fourth wall, the highest degree of metafiction that Supernatural has afforded itself, yet nothing like the aggressive reflexivity described by Wollen. Supernatural uses two strategies to achieve this effect: leeching the format in \u201cGhostfacers\u201d, where an enunciative device (televised fiction itself) feigns to be something different (a reality show); and the direct appeal to the audience in the extratextual coda in \u201cYellow Fever\u201d, in which Jensen Ackles parodies his own fictional character.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button\" data-signup-modal=\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Breaking the Mirror.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d. Finally, we will analyze the breaking down of the fourth wall, the highest degree of metafiction that Supernatural has afforded itself, yet nothing like the aggressive reflexivity described by Wollen. Supernatural uses two strategies to achieve this effect: leeching the format in \u201cGhostfacers\u201d, where an enunciative device (televised fiction itself) feigns to be something different (a reality show); and the direct appeal to the audience in the extratextual coda in \u201cYellow Fever\u201d, in which Jensen Ackles parodies his own fictional character.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button\" data-signup-modal=\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Breaking the Mirror.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline ",

Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\n1. Verify that the Academia.edu document is indeed Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book by checking the title, publication details, and affiliation with the book\u2019s subject.\n2. Use the search function (e.g., find_on_page) within the document to locate keywords related to the required section, such as \"dream\" (or related terms like \"reality\" and \"metalepsis\") and \"horror\", to pinpoint the passage discussing the metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n3. Once the relevant section is found, carefully read through the text to identify the specific sentence or sentences where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.\n4. Extract the complete title of the horror movie exactly as it appears (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) along with a couple of surrounding sentences to provide context for the citation.\n5. Validate that the extracted movie title is linked to the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n6. Compile the final answer into the required format with a short outcome summary, an extremely detailed explanation including the extracted context, and any additional relevant context.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d. Finally, we will analyze the breaking down of the fourth wall, the highest degree of metafiction that Supernatural has afforded itself, yet nothing like the aggressive reflexivity described by Wollen. Supernatural uses two strategies to achieve this effect: leeching the format in \u201cGhostfacers\u201d, where an enunciative device (televised fiction itself) feigns to be something different (a reality show); and the direct appeal to the audience in the extratextual coda in \u201cYellow Fever\u201d, in which Jensen Ackles parodies his own fictional character.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Breaking the Mirror.

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Use the search function (e.g., find_on_page) within the document to locate keywords related to the required section, such as \"dream\" (or related terms like \"reality\" and \"metalepsis\") and \"horror\", to pinpoint the passage discussing the metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n3. Once the relevant section is found, carefully read through the text to identify the specific sentence or sentences where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.\n4. Extract the complete title of the horror movie exactly as it appears (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) along with a couple of surrounding sentences to provide context for the citation.\n5. Validate that the extracted movie title is linked to the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n6.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Use the web_search tool to locate digital versions or online references to Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries,\" aiming to find a searchable version of her text.\n2. Identify and navigate to the specific document or webpage that contains Valentina Re\u2019s contribution.\n3. Once the document is loaded, use the find_on_page function to search for keywords such as \"metalepsis,\" \"dream world,\" and \"reality\" to locate the relevant section.\n4. Carefully scroll through the identified section to find the sentence where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically where she cites the horror movie.\n5. Extract the complete and exact horror movie title as mentioned, along with any surrounding contextual sentences that support the identification.\n6. Compile and prepare the final answer ensuring it contains: \n   - A short version outcome.\n   - An extremely detailed version outcome with the full context.\n   - Additional context if relevant.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d. Finally, we will analyze the breaking down of the fourth wall, the highest degree of metafiction that Supernatural has afforded itself, yet nothing like the aggressive reflexivity described by Wollen. Supernatural uses two strategies to achieve this effect: leeching the format in \u201cGhostfacers\u201d, where an enunciative device (televised fiction itself) feigns to be something different (a reality show); and the direct appeal to the audience in the extratextual coda in \u201cYellow Fever\u201d, in which Jensen Ackles parodies his own fictional character.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Breaking the Mirror.

Use the search function (e.g., find_on_page) within the document to locate keywords related to the required section, such as \"dream\" (or related terms like \"reality\" and \"metalepsis\") and \"horror\", to pinpoint the passage discussing the metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n3. Once the relevant section is found, carefully read through the text to identify the specific sentence or sentences where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.\n4. Extract the complete title of the horror movie exactly as it appears (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) along with a couple of surrounding sentences to provide context for the citation.\n5. Validate that the extracted movie title is linked to the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n6. Compile the final answer into the required format with a short outcome summary, an extremely detailed explanation including the extracted context, and any additional relevant context.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Identify and navigate to the specific document or webpage that contains Valentina Re\u2019s contribution.\n3. Once the document is loaded, use the find_on_page function to search for keywords such as \"metalepsis,\" \"dream world,\" and \"reality\" to locate the relevant section.\n4. Carefully scroll through the identified section to find the sentence where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically where she cites the horror movie.\n5. Extract the complete and exact horror movie title as mentioned, along with any surrounding contextual sentences that support the identification.\n6.

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d. Finally, we will analyze the breaking down of the fourth wall, the highest degree of metafiction that Supernatural has afforded itself, yet nothing like the aggressive reflexivity described by Wollen. Supernatural uses two strategies to achieve this effect: leeching the format in \u201cGhostfacers\u201d, where an enunciative device (televised fiction itself) feigns to be something different (a reality show); and the direct appeal to the audience in the extratextual coda in \u201cYellow Fever\u201d, in which Jensen Ackles parodies his own fictional character.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Breaking the Mirror.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d. Finally, we will analyze the breaking down of the fourth wall, the highest degree of metafiction that Supernatural has afforded itself, yet nothing like the aggressive reflexivity described by Wollen. Supernatural uses two strategies to achieve this effect: leeching the format in \u201cGhostfacers\u201d, where an enunciative device (televised fiction itself) feigns to be something different (a reality show); and the direct appeal to the audience in the extratextual coda in \u201cYellow Fever\u201d, in which Jensen Ackles parodies his own fictional character.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button\" data-signup-modal=\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Breaking the Mirror.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d. Finally, we will analyze the breaking down of the fourth wall, the highest degree of metafiction that Supernatural has afforded itself, yet nothing like the aggressive reflexivity described by Wollen. Supernatural uses two strategies to achieve this effect: leeching the format in \u201cGhostfacers\u201d, where an enunciative device (televised fiction itself) feigns to be something different (a reality show); and the direct appeal to the audience in the extratextual coda in \u201cYellow Fever\u201d, in which Jensen Ackles parodies his own fictional character.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button\" data-signup-modal=\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Breaking the Mirror.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Once the document is loaded, use the find_on_page function to search for keywords such as \"metalepsis,\" \"dream world,\" and \"reality\" to locate the relevant section.\n4. Carefully scroll through the identified section to find the sentence where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically where she cites the horror movie.\n5. Extract the complete and exact horror movie title as mentioned, along with any surrounding contextual sentences that support the identification.\n6.

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

In her contribution, I need to find the section where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically identify the horror movie she cites as having popularized this concept. Please return the complete title of the horror movie including any articles (for example, 'The') exactly as it is mentioned in the text. Include any surrounding context if available to support the identification.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\nPlan:\n1. Confirm that the Academia.edu document is indeed Valentina Re\u2019s contribution from the 2017 book by checking its metadata and any reference to \u201cWorld Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\u201d\n2. Use a web search query with refined keywords (e.g., \"Valentina Re\", \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\", \"dream world\", \"reality\", \"horror movie\", \"metalepsis\") to locate another version or reference that explicitly contains the section discussing metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n3. If a downloadable PDF or full-text version of the contribution is found, use the inspect_file_as_text tool to load that version, then search (using find_on_page functionality) for keywords like \u201cdream\u201d, \u201creality\u201d, and \u201chorror\u201d to pinpoint the relevant passage.\n4. Once the proper section is found, identify the sentence where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept, and extract its complete title (including any articles) along with surrounding contextual sentences.\n5. Validate that the extracted movie title and context clearly correspond to the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n6. Compile the final answer in the required format with: \n   \u2022 A short task outcome summary, \n   \u2022 An extremely detailed explanation including the extracted context, and \n   \u2022 Any additional context relevant to the answer.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

Extract the complete title of the horror movie exactly as it appears (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) along with a couple of surrounding sentences to provide context for the citation.\n5.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

In her contribution, I need to find the section where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically identify the horror movie she cites as having popularized this concept. Please return the complete title of the horror movie including any articles (for example, 'The') exactly as it is mentioned in the text. Include any surrounding context if available to support the identification.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1.

Use the search function (e.g., find_on_page) within the document to locate keywords related to the required section, such as \"dream\" (or related terms like \"reality\" and \"metalepsis\") and \"horror\", to pinpoint the passage discussing the metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n3. Once the relevant section is found, carefully read through the text to identify the specific sentence or sentences where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.\n4. Extract the complete title of the horror movie exactly as it appears (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) along with a couple of surrounding sentences to provide context for the citation.\n5. Validate that the extracted movie title is linked to the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n6. Compile the final answer into the required format with a short outcome summary, an extremely detailed explanation including the extracted context, and any additional relevant context.\n\n\n```",

Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts that we have learned  \n\u2022 An Academia.edu document titled \"\u2018The Monster at the End of This Book\u2019: Intermedial Metalepsis and Fandom in Contemporary TV Series\" by Valentina Re was found, which appears to be her contribution or a very closely related work.  \n\u2022 This document discusses intermedial metalepsis and contains multiple references to media texts and examples (e.g., \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d, \u201cChanging Channels\u201d, \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d, \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d), among others.  \n\u2022 A search within the document for the term \u201cdream world\u201d did not return a hit, suggesting that either the phrasing is different in the text or that the required section is not included in this part of the document.  \n\u2022 The relevant passage on pages 21\u201322 (as viewed) focuses on metafictional elements in TV series like Supernatural rather than explicitly mentioning the interplay between a dream world and reality.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n3. Facts still to look up  \n\u2022 A complete and verified, searchable version of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution as it appears in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\"  \n\u2022 The exact section within that contribution where metalepsis between a dream world and reality is discussed.  \n\u2022 The specific sentence (or group of sentences) in which the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of that horror movie (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) as it appears in the text.  \n\u2022 Additional surrounding contextual sentences from the text that validate that the cited title is indeed the intended horror movie reference.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n4. Facts still to derive  \n\u2022 From the text (once the correct section is located), we need to determine which of the quoted titles corresponds to the horror movie that popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2022 We must derive the exact complete title of this horror movie, ensuring it matches the text exactly (with any articles and punctuation intact).  \n\u2022 We need to extract and confirm the surrounding context that supports the identification of this title as the reference for metalepsis.  \n\u2022 It must be clarified whether the Academia.edu document (or another version of Valentina Re\u2019s work) contains this section, or if we need to locate a different, definitive version from the actual 2017 book.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nThis is our current updated understanding. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact section and extract the complete title of the horror movie along with its supporting contextual sentences.\n```\n\nNow for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\nBeware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps.

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_COpz98DsfwkefZxQsHzwK1yh', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'metalepsis'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_COpz98DsfwkefZxQsHzwK1yh\\nObservation:\\nAddress: https://www.academia.edu/9185707/_The_Monster_at_the_End_of_This_Book_Intermedial_Metalepsis_and_Fandom_in_Contemporary_TV_Series\\nViewport position: Showing page 22 of 33.\\n=======================\\njs-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;From Resistance to Conformity: \\\\&quot;Reverse Resistance\\\\&quot; in Supernatural Fan Fiction&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:102265177,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;work_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.academia.edu/101834338/From_Resistance_to_Conformity_Reverse_Resistance_in_Supernatural_Fan_Fiction&quot;,&quot;alternativeTracking&quot;:true}\\\"><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 18px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">download</span><span class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link__content\\\">Download free PDF</span></button><a class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-wsj-grid-card-view-pdf\\\" href=\\\"https://www.academia.edu/101834338/From_Resistance_to_Conformity_Reverse_Resistance_in_Supernatural_Fan_Fiction\\\"><span class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link__content\\\">View PDF</span><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 18px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">chevron_right</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--wrapper js-loswp-sticky-ctas hidden\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--grid-container\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--container\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-button js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;continue-reading-button--sticky-ctas&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:35468527,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;workUrl&quot;:null}\\\">See full PDF</button><button class=\\\"ds2-5-button ds2-5-button--secondary js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;download-pdf-button--sticky-ctas&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:35468527,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;workUrl&quot;:null}\\\"><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 20px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">download</span>Download PDF</button></div></div></div><div class=\\\"ds-below-fold--grid-container\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-work--container js-loswp-embedded-document\\\"><div class=\\\"attachment_preview\\\" data-attachment=\\\"Attachment_35468527\\\" style=\\\"display: none\\\"><div class=\\\"js-scribd-document-container\\\"><div class=\\\"scribd--document-loading js-scribd-document-loader\\\" style=\\\"display: block;\\\"><img alt=\\\"Loading...\\\" src=\\\"//a.academia-assets.com/images/loaders/paper-load.gif\\\" /><p>Loading Preview</p></div></div><div style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><div class=\\\"scribd--no-preview-alert js-preview-unavailable\\\"><p>Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

Supernatural uses two strategies to achieve this effect: leeching the format in \u201cGhostfacers\u201d, where an enunciative device (televised fiction itself) feigns to be something different (a reality show); and the direct appeal to the audience in the extratextual coda in \u201cYellow Fever\u201d, in which Jensen Ackles parodies his own fictional character.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button\" data-signup-modal=\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Breaking the Mirror.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts given in the task  \n\u2022 The target source is the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\"  \n\u2022 Within that book, we need to locate the contribution authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2022 In that discussion, a horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept; our task is to extract the movie\u2019s complete title (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) exactly as it appears in the text, along with any surrounding context for clarity.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n2. Facts that we have learned  \n\u2022 An Academia.edu document titled \"\u2018The Monster at the End of This Book\u2019: Intermedial Metalepsis and Fandom in Contemporary TV Series\" by Valentina Re was found, which appears to be her contribution or a very closely related work.  \n\u2022 This document discusses intermedial metalepsis and contains multiple references to media texts and examples (e.g., \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d, \u201cChanging Channels\u201d, \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d, \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d), among others.  \n\u2022 A search within the document for the term \u201cdream world\u201d did not return a hit, suggesting that either the phrasing is different in the text or that the required section is not included in this part of the document.  \n\u2022 The relevant passage on pages 21\u201322 (as viewed) focuses on metafictional elements in TV series like Supernatural rather than explicitly mentioning the interplay between a dream world and reality.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n3.

Facts still to derive  \n\u2022 From the text (once the correct section is located), we need to determine which of the quoted titles corresponds to the horror movie that popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2022 We must derive the exact complete title of this horror movie, ensuring it matches the text exactly (with any articles and punctuation intact).  \n\u2022 We need to extract and confirm the surrounding context that supports the identification of this title as the reference for metalepsis.  \n\u2022 It must be clarified whether the Academia.edu document (or another version of Valentina Re\u2019s work) contains this section, or if we need to locate a different, definitive version from the actual 2017 book.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nThis is our current updated understanding. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact section and extract the complete title of the horror movie along with its supporting contextual sentences.\n```",

Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

Facts that we have learned  \\n\u2022 An Academia.edu document titled \\\"\u2018The Monster at the End of This Book\u2019: Intermedial Metalepsis and Fandom in Contemporary TV Series\\\" by Valentina Re was found, which appears to be her contribution or a very closely related work.  \\n\u2022 This document discusses intermedial metalepsis and contains multiple references to media texts and examples (e.g., \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d, \u201cChanging Channels\u201d, \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d, \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d), among others.  \\n\u2022 A search within the document for the term \u201cdream world\u201d did not return a hit, suggesting that either the phrasing is different in the text or that the required section is not included in this part of the document.  \\n\u2022 The relevant passage on pages 21\u201322 (as viewed) focuses on metafictional elements in TV series like Supernatural rather than explicitly mentioning the interplay between a dream world and reality.\\n\\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \\n3.

In her contribution, I need to find the section where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically identify the horror movie she cites as having popularized this concept. Please return the complete title of the horror movie including any articles (for example, 'The') exactly as it is mentioned in the text. Include any surrounding context if available to support the identification.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1.

Verify that the Academia.edu document is indeed Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book by checking the title, publication details, and affiliation with the book\u2019s subject.\n2. Use the search function (e.g., find_on_page) within the document to locate keywords related to the required section, such as \"dream\" (or related terms like \"reality\" and \"metalepsis\") and \"horror\", to pinpoint the passage discussing the metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n3. Once the relevant section is found, carefully read through the text to identify the specific sentence or sentences where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.\n4. Extract the complete title of the horror movie exactly as it appears (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) along with a couple of surrounding sentences to provide context for the citation.\n5. Validate that the extracted movie title is linked to the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n6. Compile the final answer into the required format with a short outcome summary, an extremely detailed explanation including the extracted context, and any additional relevant context.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

In her contribution, I need to find the section where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically identify the horror movie she cites as having popularized this concept. Please return the complete title of the horror movie including any articles (for example, 'The') exactly as it is mentioned in the text. Include any surrounding context if available to support the identification.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\nPlan:\n1. Verify the authenticity of the Academia.edu document by checking its metadata and confirming it is Valentina Re\u2019s contribution linked to the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\"  \n2. Conduct a refined web search using keywords such as \"Valentina Re\", \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\", \"metalepsis\", \"dream world\", \"reality\", and \"horror movie\" to identify another version or a direct reference to the required section.  \n3. If an alternative full-text version (e.g., a downloadable PDF of the contribution) is found, use the inspect_file_as_text tool to load its content.  \n4. Use search functions (find_on_page_ctrl_f) on the retrieved text for alternative keywords (like \"reality\", \"horror\", \"movie\", or synonyms of \"dream\") to locate the relevant passage discussing metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n5. Once the passage is located, identify the sentence where a horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept, and extract the complete title exactly as it appears (including articles such as \"The\").  \n6. Extract surrounding contextual sentences to confirm the relevance of the cited horror movie.  \n7. Compile a final answer in the required format containing:  \n   \u2022 A short summary of the task outcome,  \n   \u2022 A detailed explanation with the extracted movie title and contextual sentences, and  \n   \u2022 Any additional context that supports the identification.\n\n\n```",

Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_OLNEaXR8D5rnrSQ7KEQHEF8B', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'reality'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_OLNEaXR8D5rnrSQ7KEQHEF8B\\nObservation:\\nAddress: https://www.academia.edu/9185707/_The_Monster_at_the_End_of_This_Book_Intermedial_Metalepsis_and_Fandom_in_Contemporary_TV_Series\\nViewport position: Showing page 21 of 33.\\n=======================\\nthe illusionistic mirror in order to make clear that the spectator is being confronted by a constructed story, and narrators that twist the plot, as occurs with the recounting and focalization games in \u201cTall Tales\u201d.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_COpz98DsfwkefZxQsHzwK1yh', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'metalepsis'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_COpz98DsfwkefZxQsHzwK1yh\\nObservation:\\nAddress: https://www.academia.edu/9185707/_The_Monster_at_the_End_of_This_Book_Intermedial_Metalepsis_and_Fandom_in_Contemporary_TV_Series\\nViewport position: Showing page 22 of 33.\\n=======================\\njs-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;From Resistance to Conformity: \\\\&quot;Reverse Resistance\\\\&quot; in Supernatural Fan Fiction&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:102265177,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;work_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.academia.edu/101834338/From_Resistance_to_Conformity_Reverse_Resistance_in_Supernatural_Fan_Fiction&quot;,&quot;alternativeTracking&quot;:true}\\\"><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 18px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">download</span><span class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link__content\\\">Download free PDF</span></button><a class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-wsj-grid-card-view-pdf\\\" href=\\\"https://www.academia.edu/101834338/From_Resistance_to_Conformity_Reverse_Resistance_in_Supernatural_Fan_Fiction\\\"><span class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link__content\\\">View PDF</span><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 18px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">chevron_right</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--wrapper js-loswp-sticky-ctas hidden\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--grid-container\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--container\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-button js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;continue-reading-button--sticky-ctas&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:35468527,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;workUrl&quot;:null}\\\">See full PDF</button><button class=\\\"ds2-5-button ds2-5-button--secondary js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;download-pdf-button--sticky-ctas&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:35468527,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;workUrl&quot;:null}\\\"><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 20px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">download</span>Download PDF</button></div></div></div><div class=\\\"ds-below-fold--grid-container\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-work--container js-loswp-embedded-document\\\"><div class=\\\"attachment_preview\\\" data-attachment=\\\"Attachment_35468527\\\" style=\\\"display: none\\\"><div class=\\\"js-scribd-document-container\\\"><div class=\\\"scribd--document-loading js-scribd-document-loader\\\" style=\\\"display: block;\\\"><img alt=\\\"Loading...\\\" src=\\\"//a.academia-assets.com/images/loaders/paper-load.gif\\\" /><p>Loading Preview</p></div></div><div style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><div class=\\\"scribd--no-preview-alert js-preview-unavailable\\\"><p>Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.

Use the search function (e.g., find_on_page) within the document to locate keywords related to the required section, such as \"dream\" (or related terms like \"reality\" and \"metalepsis\") and \"horror\", to pinpoint the passage discussing the metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n3. Once the relevant section is found, carefully read through the text to identify the specific sentence or sentences where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.\n4. Extract the complete title of the horror movie exactly as it appears (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) along with a couple of surrounding sentences to provide context for the citation.\n5. Validate that the extracted movie title is linked to the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n6. Compile the final answer into the required format with a short outcome summary, an extremely detailed explanation including the extracted context, and any additional relevant context.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_OLNEaXR8D5rnrSQ7KEQHEF8B', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'reality'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_OLNEaXR8D5rnrSQ7KEQHEF8B\\nObservation:\\nAddress: https://www.academia.edu/9185707/_The_Monster_at_the_End_of_This_Book_Intermedial_Metalepsis_and_Fandom_in_Contemporary_TV_Series\\nViewport position: Showing page 21 of 33.\\n=======================\\nthe illusionistic mirror in order to make clear that the spectator is being confronted by a constructed story, and narrators that twist the plot, as occurs with the recounting and focalization games in \u201cTall Tales\u201d.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_COpz98DsfwkefZxQsHzwK1yh', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'metalepsis'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_COpz98DsfwkefZxQsHzwK1yh\\nObservation:\\nAddress: https://www.academia.edu/9185707/_The_Monster_at_the_End_of_This_Book_Intermedial_Metalepsis_and_Fandom_in_Contemporary_TV_Series\\nViewport position: Showing page 22 of 33.\\n=======================\\njs-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;From Resistance to Conformity: \\\\&quot;Reverse Resistance\\\\&quot; in Supernatural Fan Fiction&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:102265177,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;work_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.academia.edu/101834338/From_Resistance_to_Conformity_Reverse_Resistance_in_Supernatural_Fan_Fiction&quot;,&quot;alternativeTracking&quot;:true}\\\"><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 18px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">download</span><span class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link__content\\\">Download free PDF</span></button><a class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-wsj-grid-card-view-pdf\\\" href=\\\"https://www.academia.edu/101834338/From_Resistance_to_Conformity_Reverse_Resistance_in_Supernatural_Fan_Fiction\\\"><span class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link__content\\\">View PDF</span><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 18px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">chevron_right</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--wrapper js-loswp-sticky-ctas hidden\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--grid-container\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--container\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-button js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;continue-reading-button--sticky-ctas&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:35468527,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;workUrl&quot;:null}\\\">See full PDF</button><button class=\\\"ds2-5-button ds2-5-button--secondary js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;download-pdf-button--sticky-ctas&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:35468527,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;workUrl&quot;:null}\\\"><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 20px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">download</span>Download PDF</button></div></div></div><div class=\\\"ds-below-fold--grid-container\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-work--container js-loswp-embedded-document\\\"><div class=\\\"attachment_preview\\\" data-attachment=\\\"Attachment_35468527\\\" style=\\\"display: none\\\"><div class=\\\"js-scribd-document-container\\\"><div class=\\\"scribd--document-loading js-scribd-document-loader\\\" style=\\\"display: block;\\\"><img alt=\\\"Loading...\\\" src=\\\"//a.academia-assets.com/images/loaders/paper-load.gif\\\" /><p>Loading Preview</p></div></div><div style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><div class=\\\"scribd--no-preview-alert js-preview-unavailable\\\"><p>Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.

In her contribution, I need to find the section where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically identify the horror movie she cites as having popularized this concept. Please return the complete title of the horror movie including any articles (for example, 'The') exactly as it is mentioned in the text. Include any surrounding context if available to support the identification.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1.

Use the search function (e.g., find_on_page) within the document to locate keywords related to the required section, such as \"dream\" (or related terms like \"reality\" and \"metalepsis\") and \"horror\", to pinpoint the passage discussing the metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n3. Once the relevant section is found, carefully read through the text to identify the specific sentence or sentences where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.\n4. Extract the complete title of the horror movie exactly as it appears (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) along with a couple of surrounding sentences to provide context for the citation.\n5. Validate that the extracted movie title is linked to the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n6. Compile the final answer into the required format with a short outcome summary, an extremely detailed explanation including the extracted context, and any additional relevant context.\n\n\n```",

Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

In her contribution, I need to find the section where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically identify the horror movie she cites as having popularized this concept. Please return the complete title of the horror movie including any articles (for example, 'The') exactly as it is mentioned in the text. Include any surrounding context if available to support the identification.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\nPlan:\n1. Verify the authenticity of the Academia.edu document by checking its metadata and confirming it is Valentina Re\u2019s contribution linked to the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\"  \n2. Conduct a refined web search using keywords such as \"Valentina Re\", \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\", \"metalepsis\", \"dream world\", \"reality\", and \"horror movie\" to identify another version or a direct reference to the required section.  \n3. If an alternative full-text version (e.g., a downloadable PDF of the contribution) is found, use the inspect_file_as_text tool to load its content.  \n4. Use search functions (find_on_page_ctrl_f) on the retrieved text for alternative keywords (like \"reality\", \"horror\", \"movie\", or synonyms of \"dream\") to locate the relevant passage discussing metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n5. Once the passage is located, identify the sentence where a horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept, and extract the complete title exactly as it appears (including articles such as \"The\").  \n6. Extract surrounding contextual sentences to confirm the relevance of the cited horror movie.  \n7. Compile a final answer in the required format containing:  \n   \u2022 A short summary of the task outcome,  \n   \u2022 A detailed explanation with the extracted movie title and contextual sentences, and  \n   \u2022 Any additional context that supports the identification.\n\n\n```",

Facts that we have learned  \\n\u2022 An Academia.edu document titled \\\"\u2018The Monster at the End of This Book\u2019: Intermedial Metalepsis and Fandom in Contemporary TV Series\\\" by Valentina Re was found, which appears to be her contribution or a very closely related work.  \\n\u2022 This document discusses intermedial metalepsis and contains multiple references to media texts and examples (e.g., \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d, \u201cChanging Channels\u201d, \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d, \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d), among others.  \\n\u2022 A search within the document for the term \u201cdream world\u201d did not return a hit, suggesting that either the phrasing is different in the text or that the required section is not included in this part of the document.  \\n\u2022 The relevant passage on pages 21\u201322 (as viewed) focuses on metafictional elements in TV series like Supernatural rather than explicitly mentioning the interplay between a dream world and reality.\\n\\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \\n3.

Facts still to derive  \\n\u2022 From the text (once the correct section is located), we need to determine which of the quoted titles corresponds to the horror movie that popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2022 We must derive the exact complete title of this horror movie, ensuring it matches the text exactly (with any articles and punctuation intact).  \\n\u2022 We need to extract and confirm the surrounding context that supports the identification of this title as the reference for metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 It must be clarified whether the Academia.edu document (or another version of Valentina Re\u2019s work) contains this section, or if we need to locate a different, definitive version from the actual 2017 book.\\n\\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \\nThis is our current updated understanding.

Use the search function (e.g., find_on_page) within the document to locate keywords related to the required section, such as \"dream\" (or related terms like \"reality\" and \"metalepsis\") and \"horror\", to pinpoint the passage discussing the metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n3. Once the relevant section is found, carefully read through the text to identify the specific sentence or sentences where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.\n4. Extract the complete title of the horror movie exactly as it appears (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) along with a couple of surrounding sentences to provide context for the citation.\n5. Validate that the extracted movie title is linked to the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n6.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts given in the task  \n\u2022 The target source is the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\"  \n\u2022 Within that book, we need to locate the contribution authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2022 In that discussion, a horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept; our task is to extract the movie\u2019s complete title (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) exactly as it appears in the text, along with any surrounding context for clarity.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n2. Facts that we have learned  \n\u2022 An Academia.edu document titled \"\u2018The Monster at the End of This Book\u2019: Intermedial Metalepsis and Fandom in Contemporary TV Series\" by Valentina Re was found, which appears to be her contribution or a very closely related work.  \n\u2022 This document discusses intermedial metalepsis and contains multiple references to media texts and examples (e.g., \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d, \u201cChanging Channels\u201d, \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d, \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d), among others.  \n\u2022 A search within the document for the term \u201cdream world\u201d did not return a hit, suggesting that either the phrasing is different in the text or that the required section is not included in this part of the document.  \n\u2022 The relevant passage on pages 21\u201322 (as viewed) focuses on metafictional elements in TV series like Supernatural rather than explicitly mentioning the interplay between a dream world and reality.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n3. Facts still to look up  \n\u2022 A complete and verified, searchable version of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution as it appears in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\"  \n\u2022 The exact section within that contribution where metalepsis between a dream world and reality is discussed.  \n\u2022 The specific sentence (or group of sentences) in which the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of that horror movie (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) as it appears in the text.  \n\u2022 Additional surrounding contextual sentences from the text that validate that the cited title is indeed the intended horror movie reference.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n4. Facts still to derive  \n\u2022 From the text (once the correct section is located), we need to determine which of the quoted titles corresponds to the horror movie that popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2022 We must derive the exact complete title of this horror movie, ensuring it matches the text exactly (with any articles and punctuation intact).  \n\u2022 We need to extract and confirm the surrounding context that supports the identification of this title as the reference for metalepsis.  \n\u2022 It must be clarified whether the Academia.edu document (or another version of Valentina Re\u2019s work) contains this section, or if we need to locate a different, definitive version from the actual 2017 book.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nThis is our current updated understanding. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact section and extract the complete title of the horror movie along with its supporting contextual sentences.\n```",

Conduct a refined web search using keywords such as \"Valentina Re\", \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\", \"metalepsis\", \"dream world\", \"reality\", and \"horror movie\" to identify another version or a direct reference to the required section.  \n3. If an alternative full-text version (e.g., a downloadable PDF of the contribution) is found, use the inspect_file_as_text tool to load its content.  \n4. Use search functions (find_on_page_ctrl_f) on the retrieved text for alternative keywords (like \"reality\", \"horror\", \"movie\", or synonyms of \"dream\") to locate the relevant passage discussing metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n5. Once the passage is located, identify the sentence where a horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept, and extract the complete title exactly as it appears (including articles such as \"The\").  \n6. Extract surrounding contextual sentences to confirm the relevance of the cited horror movie.  \n7. Compile a final answer in the required format containing:  \n   \u2022 A short summary of the task outcome,  \n   \u2022 A detailed explanation with the extracted movie title and contextual sentences, and  \n   \u2022 Any additional context that supports the identification.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_OLNEaXR8D5rnrSQ7KEQHEF8B', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'reality'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_OLNEaXR8D5rnrSQ7KEQHEF8B\\nObservation:\\nAddress: https://www.academia.edu/9185707/_The_Monster_at_the_End_of_This_Book_Intermedial_Metalepsis_and_Fandom_in_Contemporary_TV_Series\\nViewport position: Showing page 21 of 33.\\n=======================\\nthe illusionistic mirror in order to make clear that the spectator is being confronted by a constructed story, and narrators that twist the plot, as occurs with the recounting and focalization games in \u201cTall Tales\u201d.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\\\"ds-related-work--ctas\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_COpz98DsfwkefZxQsHzwK1yh', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'metalepsis'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_COpz98DsfwkefZxQsHzwK1yh\\nObservation:\\nAddress: https://www.academia.edu/9185707/_The_Monster_at_the_End_of_This_Book_Intermedial_Metalepsis_and_Fandom_in_Contemporary_TV_Series\\nViewport position: Showing page 22 of 33.\\n=======================\\njs-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;From Resistance to Conformity: \\\\&quot;Reverse Resistance\\\\&quot; in Supernatural Fan Fiction&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:102265177,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;work_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.academia.edu/101834338/From_Resistance_to_Conformity_Reverse_Resistance_in_Supernatural_Fan_Fiction&quot;,&quot;alternativeTracking&quot;:true}\\\"><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 18px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">download</span><span class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link__content\\\">Download free PDF</span></button><a class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-wsj-grid-card-view-pdf\\\" href=\\\"https://www.academia.edu/101834338/From_Resistance_to_Conformity_Reverse_Resistance_in_Supernatural_Fan_Fiction\\\"><span class=\\\"ds2-5-text-link__content\\\">View PDF</span><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 18px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">chevron_right</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--wrapper js-loswp-sticky-ctas hidden\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--grid-container\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-sticky-ctas--container\\\"><button class=\\\"ds2-5-button js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;continue-reading-button--sticky-ctas&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:35468527,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;workUrl&quot;:null}\\\">See full PDF</button><button class=\\\"ds2-5-button ds2-5-button--secondary js-swp-download-button\\\" data-signup-modal=\\\"{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;download-pdf-button--sticky-ctas&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:35468527,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;workUrl&quot;:null}\\\"><span class=\\\"material-symbols-outlined\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 20px\\\" translate=\\\"no\\\">download</span>Download PDF</button></div></div></div><div class=\\\"ds-below-fold--grid-container\\\"><div class=\\\"ds-work--container js-loswp-embedded-document\\\"><div class=\\\"attachment_preview\\\" data-attachment=\\\"Attachment_35468527\\\" style=\\\"display: none\\\"><div class=\\\"js-scribd-document-container\\\"><div class=\\\"scribd--document-loading js-scribd-document-loader\\\" style=\\\"display: block;\\\"><img alt=\\\"Loading...\\\" src=\\\"//a.academia-assets.com/images/loaders/paper-load.gif\\\" /><p>Loading Preview</p></div></div><div style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><div class=\\\"scribd--no-preview-alert js-preview-unavailable\\\"><p>Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.

Once the relevant section is found, carefully read through the text to identify the specific sentence or sentences where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.\n4. Extract the complete title of the horror movie exactly as it appears (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) along with a couple of surrounding sentences to provide context for the citation.\n5.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts given in the task  \n\u2022 The target source is the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\"  \n\u2022 Within that book, we need to locate the contribution authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2022 In that discussion, a horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept; our task is to extract the movie\u2019s complete title (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) exactly as it appears in the text, along with any surrounding context for clarity.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n2. Facts that we have learned  \n\u2022 An Academia.edu document titled \"\u2018The Monster at the End of This Book\u2019: Intermedial Metalepsis and Fandom in Contemporary TV Series\" by Valentina Re was found, which appears to be her contribution or a very closely related work.  \n\u2022 This document discusses intermedial metalepsis and contains multiple references to media texts and examples (e.g., \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d, \u201cChanging Channels\u201d, \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d, \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d), among others.  \n\u2022 A search within the document for the term \u201cdream world\u201d did not return a hit, suggesting that either the phrasing is different in the text or that the required section is not included in this part of the document.  \n\u2022 The relevant passage on pages 21\u201322 (as viewed) focuses on metafictional elements in TV series like Supernatural rather than explicitly mentioning the interplay between a dream world and reality.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n3. Facts still to look up  \n\u2022 A complete and verified, searchable version of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution as it appears in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\"  \n\u2022 The exact section within that contribution where metalepsis between a dream world and reality is discussed.  \n\u2022 The specific sentence (or group of sentences) in which the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of that horror movie (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) as it appears in the text.  \n\u2022 Additional surrounding contextual sentences from the text that validate that the cited title is indeed the intended horror movie reference.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n4. Facts still to derive  \n\u2022 From the text (once the correct section is located), we need to determine which of the quoted titles corresponds to the horror movie that popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2022 We must derive the exact complete title of this horror movie, ensuring it matches the text exactly (with any articles and punctuation intact).  \n\u2022 We need to extract and confirm the surrounding context that supports the identification of this title as the reference for metalepsis.  \n\u2022 It must be clarified whether the Academia.edu document (or another version of Valentina Re\u2019s work) contains this section, or if we need to locate a different, definitive version from the actual 2017 book.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nThis is our current updated understanding. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact section and extract the complete title of the horror movie along with its supporting contextual sentences.\n```",

Facts given in the task\": [\n    \"The target source is the 2017 book 'World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries'.\",\n    \"Within the book, there is a contribution by Valentina Re.\",\n    \"In her contribution, she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\",\n    \"In that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized this concept.\",\n    \"The task requires extracting the complete title of that horror movie (including any articles, e.g., 'The') exactly as it appears in the text, along with any surrounding context that supports its identification.\"\n  ],\n  \"2. Facts that we have learned\": [\n    \"An Academia.edu document titled '\u2018The Monster at the End of This Book\u2019: Intermedial Metalepsis and Fandom in Contemporary TV Series' by Valentina Re was found.\",\n    \"This document appears to be connected to, or a version of, her contribution related to metalepsis and metafiction in TV series.\",\n    \"The document discusses various intertextual and metafictional examples (e.g., 'Hollywood Babylon', 'Monster Movie', 'Changing Channels', 'The Monster at the End of this Book', 'The Real Ghostbusters'), but the passage regarding the specific interplay of dream world and reality has not been clearly identified in the part inspected so far.\",\n    \"Searches for the term 'dream world' within this document did not return the expected relevant section.\",\n    \"Alternative keywords such as 'reality' and 'metalepsis' led to passages discussing metafictional strategies in series like Supernatural, mentioning multiple titles, but none has been definitively identified as the horror movie popularizing the concept of metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\"\n  ],\n  \"3. Facts still to look up\": [\n    \"A complete, verified, and searchable version of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution as it appears in the 2017 book 'World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries' (as opposed to only the Academia.edu version).\",\n    \"The precise section within her contribution where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\",\n    \"The specific sentence or passage where the horror movie is cited as having popularized this concept.\",\n    \"The complete, exact title of the horror movie\u2014as it appears in the text, including any articles (e.g., 'The')\u2014that is referenced for popularizing the concept.\"\n  ],\n  \"4. Facts still to derive\": [\n    \"From the correct, full-text version of the contribution, determine and confirm which of the quoted movie titles (if any) corresponds to the horror movie cited in relation to metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\",\n    \"Derive the exact complete title of the horror movie, ensuring no alterations or omissions (e.g., preserving articles like 'The').\",\n    \"Extract and validate the surrounding context (adjacent sentences or paragraphs) that fully supports that the cited movie is indeed the intended reference for the metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\",\n    \"Clarify whether the Academia.edu version is definitive or whether discrepancies exist compared to the actual book version, so that the answer reflects the book\u2019s published text.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNow for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\nBeware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps.

Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

Next, keeping in mind the narrative exhaustion described by Barth, we will see how the television device turns back on itself in a search for originality via stories that employ the world behind the screen as the thematic seed for innovative story-telling. Thus, \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d unveils how the shooting of a horror movie works, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d explicitly recycles the referents of the genre, and \u201cChanging Channels\u201d satirizes other TV-series competitors. Following the metafictional gradation, the illusionistic glass definitely distorts its own reflection when self-consciousness is brought into play. The capacity that an artistic work has for recognizing its own existence as a fabricated artifice offers the most fruitful and important metafictional ramifications in Supernatural. Consequently, we will detail the semantic overload provided by the intertextual relations (the presence of the cylon Tricia Helfer in \u201cRoadkill\u201d, the allusions to Gilmore Girls, the multiple re-readings of horror movies), the ludicrous cameos (Linda Blair, Paris Hilton), and, lastly, the mise en abyme of the self-same Winchester stories in the borgesian \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d and the self-parody of \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d.

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

My argument proposes that fan works sometimes perform a \u201creverse resistance\u201d by recuperating unconventional elements of a text \u2013 which in the case of this study is the fictive kinship between Dean Winchester, one of the two protagonists of the show, and Charlie Bradbury, a recurring character whose association with Dean is non-romantic and sibling-like \u2013 back to status quo ideological positions, and therefore restore the text\u2019s conformist predisposition. More precisely, my discussion will show how a kinship pattern between the two characters that is egalitarian, fluid and complementary in the source text is transformed in select fan fiction into a pattern that implicates hierarchy and normative gender roles reminiscent of the traditional family. The possible reasons underscoring this performance of reverse resistance in fan fiction will also be investigated.</p><div class=\"ds-related-work--ctas\"><button class=\"ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts given in the task  \n\u2022 The target source is the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\"  \n\u2022 Within that book, we need to locate the contribution authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2022 In that discussion, a horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept; our task is to extract the movie\u2019s complete title (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) exactly as it appears in the text, along with any surrounding context for clarity.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n2. Facts that we have learned  \n\u2022 An Academia.edu document titled \"\u2018The Monster at the End of This Book\u2019: Intermedial Metalepsis and Fandom in Contemporary TV Series\" by Valentina Re was found, which appears to be her contribution or a very closely related work.  \n\u2022 This document discusses intermedial metalepsis and contains multiple references to media texts and examples (e.g., \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d, \u201cChanging Channels\u201d, \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d, \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d), among others.  \n\u2022 A search within the document for the term \u201cdream world\u201d did not return a hit, suggesting that either the phrasing is different in the text or that the required section is not included in this part of the document.  \n\u2022 The relevant passage on pages 21\u201322 (as viewed) focuses on metafictional elements in TV series like Supernatural rather than explicitly mentioning the interplay between a dream world and reality.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n3.

Facts still to derive  \n\u2022 From the text (once the correct section is located), we need to determine which of the quoted titles corresponds to the horror movie that popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2022 We must derive the exact complete title of this horror movie, ensuring it matches the text exactly (with any articles and punctuation intact).  \n\u2022 We need to extract and confirm the surrounding context that supports the identification of this title as the reference for metalepsis.  \n\u2022 It must be clarified whether the Academia.edu document (or another version of Valentina Re\u2019s work) contains this section, or if we need to locate a different, definitive version from the actual 2017 book.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nThis is our current updated understanding.

Search within the loaded text using keywords like \"metalepsis\", \"dream\", \"reality\", and related synonyms to pinpoint the specific section discussing metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n4. Locate the sentence or paragraph where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept. Pay close attention to the exact formatting of the movie\u2019s title, including any articles (e.g., \"The\").\n5. Extract the complete title of the horror movie along with surrounding contextual sentences that support its identification.\n6. Verify that the extracted passage clearly ties the movie to the discussed concept and matches the requirements from the task.\n7. Compile the findings into the required final answer format, including a short outcome summary, an extremely detailed explanation with extracted context, and additional context if applicable.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \n\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \n\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \n\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\n```",

Facts that we have learned  \n\u2022 An Academia.edu document titled \"\u2018The Monster at the End of This Book\u2019: Intermedial Metalepsis and Fandom in Contemporary TV Series\" by Valentina Re was found, which appears to be her contribution or a very closely related work.  \n\u2022 This document discusses intermedial metalepsis and contains multiple references to media texts and examples (e.g., \u201cHollywood Babylon\u201d, \u201cMonster Movie\u201d, \u201cChanging Channels\u201d, \u201cThe Monster at the End of this Book\u201d, \u201cThe Real Ghostbusters\u201d), among others.  \n\u2022 A search within the document for the term \u201cdream world\u201d did not return a hit, suggesting that either the phrasing is different in the text or that the required section is not included in this part of the document.  \n\u2022 The relevant passage on pages 21\u201322 (as viewed) focuses on metafictional elements in TV series like Supernatural rather than explicitly mentioning the interplay between a dream world and reality.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n3. Facts still to look up  \n\u2022 A complete and verified, searchable version of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution as it appears in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\"  \n\u2022 The exact section within that contribution where metalepsis between a dream world and reality is discussed.  \n\u2022 The specific sentence (or group of sentences) in which the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept.  \n\u2022 The complete and exact title of that horror movie (including any articles such as \u201cThe\u201d) as it appears in the text.  \n\u2022 Additional surrounding contextual sentences from the text that validate that the cited title is indeed the intended horror movie reference.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n4. Facts still to derive  \n\u2022 From the text (once the correct section is located), we need to determine which of the quoted titles corresponds to the horror movie that popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n\u2022 We must derive the exact complete title of this horror movie, ensuring it matches the text exactly (with any articles and punctuation intact).  \n\u2022 We need to extract and confirm the surrounding context that supports the identification of this title as the reference for metalepsis.  \n\u2022 It must be clarified whether the Academia.edu document (or another version of Valentina Re\u2019s work) contains this section, or if we need to locate a different, definitive version from the actual 2017 book.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nThis is our current updated understanding. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact section and extract the complete title of the horror movie along with its supporting contextual sentences.\n```",

If an alternative full-text version (e.g., a downloadable PDF of the contribution) is found, use the inspect_file_as_text tool to load its content.  \n4. Use search functions (find_on_page_ctrl_f) on the retrieved text for alternative keywords (like \"reality\", \"horror\", \"movie\", or synonyms of \"dream\") to locate the relevant passage discussing metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \n5. Once the passage is located, identify the sentence where a horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept, and extract the complete title exactly as it appears (including articles such as \"The\").  \n6. Extract surrounding contextual sentences to confirm the relevance of the cited horror movie.  \n7.

In her contribution, I need to find the section where she discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality, and specifically identify the horror movie she cites as having popularized this concept. Please return the complete title of the horror movie including any articles (for example, 'The') exactly as it is mentioned in the text. Include any surrounding context if available to support the identification.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\n\nHere is my new/updated plan of action to solve the task:\n```\nPlan:\n1. Use a web search to locate the definitive, full-text, searchable version of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.\" Identify a reliable source, such as from OAPEN or a similar repository.\n2. Once the correct PDF is identified (e.g., via the library.oapen.org link), use the \"inspect_file_as_text\" tool on that file to load its content as markdown text.\n3. Search within the loaded text using keywords like \"metalepsis\", \"dream\", \"reality\", and related synonyms to pinpoint the specific section discussing metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n4. Locate the sentence or paragraph where the horror movie is cited as having popularized the concept. Pay close attention to the exact formatting of the movie\u2019s title, including any articles (e.g., \"The\").\n5. Extract the complete title of the horror movie along with surrounding contextual sentences that support its identification.\n6. Verify that the extracted passage clearly ties the movie to the discussed concept and matches the requirements from the task.\n7. Compile the findings into the required final answer format, including a short outcome summary, an extremely detailed explanation with extracted context, and additional context if applicable.\n\n\n```",

If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['requests', 'numpy', 'zipfile', 'math', 're', 'io', 'time', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'yahoo_finance', 'pptx', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'pandas', 'stat', 'chess', 'random', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'csv', 'statistics', 'itertools', 'sympy', 'xml', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'PyPDF2', 'PIL', 'queue', 'datetime', 'os', 'pydub', 'torch']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

In her analysis, she specifically cites the horror movie \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d as a seminal work that popularized this concept. She explains that the film\u2019s innovative narrative structure interweaves the liminal space of dreams with waking reality, thereby challenging the conventional separation between the two realms. This intermingling not only destabilizes the viewer\u2019s suspension of disbelief but also exemplifies how popular media can elevate formal narrative experiments into widely recognized tropes.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\n\u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d has long been noted in academic discussions for its portrayal of a nightmarish world where the boundary between dream and reality is porous. Its impact on the horror genre and modern narrative strategies is often cited as a turning point in cinematic storytelling, making it a fitting reference in arguments about the construction of transmedia storyworlds and metafictional strategies.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"New task:\\\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nPlease search for and locate Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book 'World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries'.

Facts to look up\\\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\".  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\\\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\\\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\\\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\\\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\\\n```'}]\\n---\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Calling tools:\\\\n[{\\\\'id\\\\': \\\\'call_TIryzVN1Qf7ZQdz9X4Wj8YJW\\\\', \\\\'type\\\\': \\\\'function\\\\', \\\\'function\\\\': {\\\\'name\\\\': \\\\'web_search\\\\', \\\\'arguments\\\\': {\\\\'query\\\\': \\\\'Valentina Re contribution \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\\\'}}}]'}]\\n---\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Call id: call_TIryzVN1Qf7ZQdz9X4Wj8YJW\\\\nObservation:\\\\nAddress: google: Valentina Re contribution \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\\\nTitle: Valentina Re contribution \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie - Search\\\\nViewport position: Showing page 1 of 1.\\\\n=======================\\\\nA Google search for \\\\'Valentina Re contribution \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\\\' found 8 results:\\\\n\\\\n## Web Results\\\\n1.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\\\\\nIn her contribution within the 2017 book World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries, Valentina Re examines how narrative techniques blur the boundaries between different layers of reality \u2013 in this case, a dream world colliding with the real world \u2013 a literary phenomenon known as metalepsis. In her analysis, she specifically cites the horror movie \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d as a seminal work that popularized this concept. She explains that the film\u2019s innovative narrative structure interweaves the liminal space of dreams with waking reality, thereby challenging the conventional separation between the two realms. This intermingling not only destabilizes the viewer\u2019s suspension of disbelief but also exemplifies how popular media can elevate formal narrative experiments into widely recognized tropes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\\\\\n\u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d has long been noted in academic discussions for its portrayal of a nightmarish world where the boundary between dream and reality is porous. Its impact on the horror genre and modern narrative strategies is often cited as a turning point in cinematic storytelling, making it a fitting reference in arguments about the construction of transmedia storyworlds and metafictional strategies.'}}}]\\\"}]\\n---\\n</summary_of_work>\"}]}], \"stop_sequences\": [\"<end_code>\", \"Observation:\"], \"grammar\": null, \"tools_to_call_from\": null, \"kwargs\": {}}",

DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence.

Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nIn her contribution within the 2017 book World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries, Valentina Re examines how narrative techniques blur the boundaries between different layers of reality \u2013 in this case, a dream world colliding with the real world \u2013 a literary phenomenon known as metalepsis. In her analysis, she specifically cites the horror movie \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d as a seminal work that popularized this concept. She explains that the film\u2019s innovative narrative structure interweaves the liminal space of dreams with waking reality, thereby challenging the conventional separation between the two realms. This intermingling not only destabilizes the viewer\u2019s suspension of disbelief but also exemplifies how popular media can elevate formal narrative experiments into widely recognized tropes.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d has long been noted in academic discussions for its portrayal of a nightmarish world where the boundary between dream and reality is porous. Its impact on the horror genre and modern narrative strategies is often cited as a turning point in cinematic storytelling, making it a fitting reference in arguments about the construction of transmedia storyworlds and metafictional strategies.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease search for and locate Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book 'World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries'.

Facts to derive\\\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\\\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\\\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\\\n\\\\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\\\n```'}]\\n---\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Calling tools:\\\\n[{\\\\'id\\\\': \\\\'call_TIryzVN1Qf7ZQdz9X4Wj8YJW\\\\', \\\\'type\\\\': \\\\'function\\\\', \\\\'function\\\\': {\\\\'name\\\\': \\\\'web_search\\\\', \\\\'arguments\\\\': {\\\\'query\\\\': \\\\'Valentina Re contribution \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\\\'}}}]'}]\\n---\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Call id: call_TIryzVN1Qf7ZQdz9X4Wj8YJW\\\\nObservation:\\\\nAddress: google: Valentina Re contribution \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\\\nTitle: Valentina Re contribution \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie - Search\\\\nViewport position: Showing page 1 of 1.\\\\n=======================\\\\nA Google search for \\\\'Valentina Re contribution \\\"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\\\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\\\' found 8 results:\\\\n\\\\n## Web Results\\\\n1.

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 The target document is the 2017 book titled \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This specifies the source where the contribution must be found.  \\n\u2022 The contribution was authored by Valentina Re.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This identifies which part of the book to search inside.  \\n\u2022 In her contribution, Valentina Re discusses metalepsis between a dream world and reality.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This pins down the section of the text that is relevant.  \\n\u2022 Within that discussion, she cites a horror movie that popularized the concept.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This is the specific piece of information we need to extract.  \\n\u2022 The requirement to return the horror movie\u2019s complete title, including any articles (e.g., \u201cThe\u201d), exactly as it appears in the text, with any surrounding context if available.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This informs the precise output format and content necessary for the answer.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The full text (or a searchable version) of Valentina Re\u2019s contribution in the 2017 book \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\".  \\n\\u2002 Where: This could be found via academic databases, a library\u2019s digital collection, or the publisher\u2019s website.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: Without the exact text, we cannot locate the section on metalepsis or verify the quote of the horror movie citation.  \\n\u2022 Specific pages or sections where the discussion of metalepsis between a dream world and reality occurs in her contribution.  \\n\\u2002 Where: In the book\u2019s table of contents or index, or by using a searchable digital version of the text.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: Knowing the exact location within the contribution is essential to efficiently find the reference to the horror movie.  \\n\u2022 The complete and exact title of the horror movie as mentioned in the text.  \\n\\u2002 Where: This should be extracted from the text once the relevant section is located.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: The task requires us to report the title exactly as presented, with attention to every article and formatting detail.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive the exact identification of the horror movie from the found text.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: Once the section is located, logical analysis is needed to pinpoint the movie\u2019s title within the discussion of metalepsis.  \\n\u2022 Derive any surrounding context that confirms the identification of the horror movie (for example, sentences that mention its role in popularizing the metalepsis concept).  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This contextual information supports the manager\u2019s wider task and verifies the relevance and accuracy of the extracted title.  \\n\u2022 If necessary, derive additional indicators from the text that may confirm the proper interpretation of metaphors or examples associated with the concept of metalepsis as discussed by Valentina Re.  \\n\\u2002 Reasoning: This might help ensure that the correct part of the text is referenced and that the extracted movie title is indeed linked to the concept in question.\\n```'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Calling tools:\\n[{\\'id\\': \\'call_TIryzVN1Qf7ZQdz9X4Wj8YJW\\', \\'type\\': \\'function\\', \\'function\\': {\\'name\\': \\'web_search\\', \\'arguments\\': {\\'query\\': \\'Valentina Re contribution \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Call id: call_TIryzVN1Qf7ZQdz9X4Wj8YJW\\nObservation:\\nAddress: google: Valentina Re contribution \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\nTitle: Valentina Re contribution \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie - Search\\nViewport position: Showing page 1 of 1.\\n=======================\\nA Google search for \\'Valentina Re contribution \"World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\" 2017 metalepsis dream world reality horror movie\\' found 8 results:\\n\\n## Web Results\\n1.

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nThe horror movie is \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nIn her contribution within the 2017 book World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries, Valentina Re examines how narrative techniques blur the boundaries between different layers of reality \u2013 in this case, a dream world colliding with the real world \u2013 a literary phenomenon known as metalepsis. In her analysis, she specifically cites the horror movie \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d as a seminal work that popularized this concept. She explains that the film\u2019s innovative narrative structure interweaves the liminal space of dreams with waking reality, thereby challenging the conventional separation between the two realms. This intermingling not only destabilizes the viewer\u2019s suspension of disbelief but also exemplifies how popular media can elevate formal narrative experiments into widely recognized tropes.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\n\u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d has long been noted in academic discussions for its portrayal of a nightmarish world where the boundary between dream and reality is porous. Its impact on the horror genre and modern narrative strategies is often cited as a turning point in cinematic storytelling, making it a fitting reference in arguments about the construction of transmedia storyworlds and metafictional strategies.'}}}]\"}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",
