Task outcome (short version):\nThe museum record for accession number 2022.128 is a photograph by Buck Ellison titled \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003.\u201d The image shows a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug, holding a book titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. \n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nThe record, as presented on the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s website, gives the following details:\n\u2022 Title: \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003\u201d (displayed in the headline, with the artist\u2019s name, Buck Ellison, linked on the page).\n\u2022 Date and Medium: The work is catalogued as a 2021 inkjet print. Its dimensions are noted as \u201cSheet: 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. (101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm)\u201d with the image itself matching these dimensions.\n\u2022 Accession Number & Edition: Accession number 2022.128 is clearly listed along with an edition note (1/5 | 2AP). The credit line indicates that the work was purchased using funds from the Photography Committee at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\n\u2022 Detailed Description (from the image alt text): The photograph depicts a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug. He is holding a book, and the alt text precisely states that the book is titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nWhile the museum record is detailed in terms of artwork specifications (title, medium, dimensions, edition, and credit), it does not include an extended biography of the individual depicted in the photograph aside from the visual description provided in the alt text. The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d). For more extensive biographical data on either Buck Ellison (the artist) or the subject, one may need to refer to additional resources or the artist\u2019s linked biography; however, as far as the museum record is concerned, the above comprises all the available relevant information.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease provide the detailed museum record for the photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nThe record, as presented on the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s website, gives the following details:\\\\n\u2022 Title: \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003\u201d (displayed in the headline, with the artist\u2019s name, Buck Ellison, linked on the page).\\\\n\u2022 Date and Medium: The work is catalogued as a 2021 inkjet print. Its dimensions are noted as \u201cSheet: 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. (101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm)\u201d with the image itself matching these dimensions.\\\\n\u2022 Accession Number & Edition: Accession number 2022.128 is clearly listed along with an edition note (1/5 | 2AP).

He is holding a book, and the alt text precisely states that the book is titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\\\\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nWhile the museum record is detailed in terms of artwork specifications (title, medium, dimensions, edition, and credit), it does not include an extended biography of the individual depicted in the photograph aside from the visual description provided in the alt text. The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d). For more extensive biographical data on either Buck Ellison (the artist) or the subject, one may need to refer to additional resources or the artist\u2019s linked biography; however, as far as the museum record is concerned, the above comprises all the available relevant information.'}}}]\"}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>\nLast output from code snippet:\nNone",

Its dimensions are noted as \u201cSheet: 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. (101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm)\u201d with the image itself matching these dimensions.\n\u2022 Accession Number & Edition: Accession number 2022.128 is clearly listed along with an edition note (1/5 | 2AP). The credit line indicates that the work was purchased using funds from the Photography Committee at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\n\u2022 Detailed Description (from the image alt text): The photograph depicts a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug. He is holding a book, and the alt text precisely states that the book is titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The artwork is a photograph that is part of the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection.  \n\u2022 The photograph\u2019s accession number is 2022.128.  \n\u2022 The museum record for this photograph should include specific elements: its title, its description, and biographical information about the person shown in the photograph.  \n\u2022 In the biographical details, particular attention is needed regarding identification details for the author of the book the person is holding.\n\n  \n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The official museum record corresponding to accession number 2022.128 from the Whitney Museum of American Art. This record would ideally be found on the Whitney Museum\u2019s online collection database or a related online catalogue.  \n\u2022 Additional documentation or digital files linked from the museum record (if any) that provide extended details, such as exhibition catalogs or archival materials.  \n\u2022 Reliable biographical data about the person featured in the photograph from sources like museum archives, artist biographies, or related scholarly publications, with a focus on confirming the identity of the book\u2019s author.  \n\u2022 Information about the specific book held by the person in the photograph to determine the author's identity\u2014this might require searching within museum notes, accompanying publication materials, or external literary/biographical databases.\n\n  \n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 From the museum record, extract and clearly present the title of the photograph.  \n\u2022 From the museum record, extract and summarize the description of the photograph as provided by the museum.  \n\u2022 Synthesize the biographical information provided in the museum record to compile a comprehensive biography of the person shown, including all available details that might indicate who the book\u2019s author is.  \n\u2022 Use logical reasoning to connect the details in the museum record (and any supplementary resources) to definitively identify or describe the author of the book held by the person, if the record does not state it explicitly.\n```\n\nNow begin!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Perform a web search query (think a google search) and returns the search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The web search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"[Optional parameter]: filter the search results to only include pages from a specific year. For example, '2020' will only include pages from 2020. Make sure to use this parameter if you're trying to search for articles from a specific date!\", 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_page: Visit a webpage at a given URL and return its text. Given a url to a YouTube video, this returns the transcript.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The relative or absolute url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_up: Scroll the viewport UP one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_down: Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_on_page_ctrl_f: Scroll the viewport to the first occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for. Give this date in the format 'YYYYMMDD', for instance '27 June 2008' is written as '20080627'.\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Look specifically for any mention of a person holding a book and any identifying details about the author of that book; note if this information is absent.\\n5. If the needed details regarding the book and its author are not found on the page, consider performing an external web search using the person's name (if identified from the record) and additional keywords (e.g., \\\"book\\\", \\\"author\\\", \\\"biography\\\") to supplement the information.\\n6.

Scroll through the museum record webpage to locate additional sections beyond the header and meta information, specifically looking for a detailed description and biographical information.\n2. Use the \"find_on_page_ctrl_f\" tool to search for keywords such as \"description\", \"biography\", \"subject\", and \"book\" on the page to pinpoint any sections with the needed information.\n3. If additional narrative or curatorial text is available further down on the page, extract that content to capture the title, detailed description of the photograph, and any biographical details of the depicted person.\n4. Look specifically for any mention of a person holding a book and any identifying details about the author of that book; note if this information is absent.\n5. If the needed details regarding the book and its author are not found on the page, consider performing an external web search using the person's name (if identified from the record) and additional keywords (e.g., \"book\", \"author\", \"biography\") to supplement the information.\n6. Compile the extracted information into a final answer that includes: (1) a short version of the task outcome; (2) an extremely detailed version, explaining the title, complete description, and any biographical data along with notes about the book held; and (3) additional context on any search limitations or missing data.\n7. Finalize the answer in the required format using the final_answer tool.\n\n\n```",

If additional narrative or curatorial text is available further down on the page, extract that content to capture the title, detailed description of the photograph, and any biographical details of the depicted person.\\n4. Look specifically for any mention of a person holding a book and any identifying details about the author of that book; note if this information is absent.\\n5. If the needed details regarding the book and its author are not found on the page, consider performing an external web search using the person's name (if identified from the record) and additional keywords (e.g., \\\"book\\\", \\\"author\\\", \\\"biography\\\") to supplement the information.\\n6.

Look specifically for any mention of a person holding a book and any identifying details about the author of that book; note if this information is absent.\n5. If the needed details regarding the book and its author are not found on the page, consider performing an external web search using the person's name (if identified from the record) and additional keywords (e.g., \"book\", \"author\", \"biography\") to supplement the information.\n6.

Facts given in the task  \n\u2022 The task concerns a photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.  \n\u2022 You need the detailed museum record including (a) the title, (b) the detailed description of the photograph, and (c) any biographical information about the person shown, with special emphasis on information that identifies the author of the book held by that person.  \n\u2022 The answer must be provided with a short version, an extremely detailed version, and additional context if relevant.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n2. Facts that we have learned  \n\u2022 The museum record page we accessed (work number 65848) belongs to Buck Ellison\u2019s work titled \u201cBuck Ellison | Rain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003.\u201d  \n\u2022 The artwork\u2019s dimensions and medium are provided (an inkjet print on sheet measuring 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. or 101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm).  \n\u2022 The record indicates that the work was purchased with funds from the Photography Committee under accession number 2022.128.  \n\u2022 A search on the page for the specific term \u201cbook held\u201d did not return any immediate results, suggesting that details about a book the person is holding may not be explicitly mentioned in the visible text.  \n\u2022 There have been technical issues when attempting to scroll down the page using the \"page_down\" tool, so not all parts of the webpage have been reviewed yet.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n3. Facts still to look up  \n\u2022 Whether further down on the museum record webpage there is additional narrative or curatorial text that includes a detailed description of the photograph.  \n\u2022 Additional biographical information regarding the person shown in the photograph\u2014if it exists on this page or via links from the record.  \n\u2022 Specific details that mention or describe the book held by the person, including any direct reference that identifies the author of that book.  \n\u2022 If the webpage itself does not contain the needed details, it may be necessary to consult external sources or related scholarly resources for more comprehensive biographical data or exhibition catalog information.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n4. Facts still to derive  \n\u2022 A clear extraction of the title as officially given by the museum record (beyond the metadata).  \n\u2022 A complete, detailed description of the photograph as provided by the museum\u2019s record.  \n\u2022 A synthesized biography of the person depicted (if available) using all the provided information, particularly focusing on identifying details regarding the author of the book they are holding.  \n\u2022 Logical deductions or integrations of supplementary details, if needed, to fill in gaps about the book\u2019s author if the museum record itself lacks explicit information.\n\nThis updated list of facts forms the foundation for further investigation and answering the manager\u2019s task comprehensively.\n```\n\nNow for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\nBeware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.\nAfter writing the final step of the plan, write the '\\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.\n\nNow write your new plan below.",

Facts given in the task  \n\u2022 The task concerns a photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.  \n\u2022 You need the detailed museum record including (a) the title, (b) the detailed description of the photograph, and (c) any biographical information about the person shown, with special emphasis on information that identifies the author of the book held by that person.  \n\u2022 The answer must be provided with a short version, an extremely detailed version, and additional context if relevant.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n2. Facts that we have learned  \n\u2022 The museum record page we accessed (work number 65848) belongs to Buck Ellison\u2019s work titled \u201cBuck Ellison | Rain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003.\u201d  \n\u2022 The artwork\u2019s dimensions and medium are provided (an inkjet print on sheet measuring 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. or 101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm).  \n\u2022 The record indicates that the work was purchased with funds from the Photography Committee under accession number 2022.128.  \n\u2022 A search on the page for the specific term \u201cbook held\u201d did not return any immediate results, suggesting that details about a book the person is holding may not be explicitly mentioned in the visible text.  \n\u2022 There have been technical issues when attempting to scroll down the page using the \"page_down\" tool, so not all parts of the webpage have been reviewed yet.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n3. Facts still to look up  \n\u2022 Whether further down on the museum record webpage there is additional narrative or curatorial text that includes a detailed description of the photograph.  \n\u2022 Additional biographical information regarding the person shown in the photograph\u2014if it exists on this page or via links from the record.  \n\u2022 Specific details that mention or describe the book held by the person, including any direct reference that identifies the author of that book.  \n\u2022 If the webpage itself does not contain the needed details, it may be necessary to consult external sources or related scholarly resources for more comprehensive biographical data or exhibition catalog information.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n4. Facts still to derive  \n\u2022 A clear extraction of the title as officially given by the museum record (beyond the metadata).  \n\u2022 A complete, detailed description of the photograph as provided by the museum\u2019s record.  \n\u2022 A synthesized biography of the person depicted (if available) using all the provided information, particularly focusing on identifying details regarding the author of the book they are holding.  \n\u2022 Logical deductions or integrations of supplementary details, if needed, to fill in gaps about the book\u2019s author if the museum record itself lacks explicit information.\n\nThis updated list of facts forms the foundation for further investigation and answering the manager\u2019s task comprehensively.\n```",

Confirm that the museum record belongs to accession number 2022.128 by reviewing the current webpage and verifying metadata (i.e. the artwork title, medium, dimensions, and purchase details).\n2. Use search techniques (e.g., the find_on_page tool) to locate additional sections on the page containing a detailed description of the photograph.\n3. Search for any curatorial or narrative text providing biographical information about the subject of the photograph, with attention to keywords such as \"bio\", \"biographical\", \"subject\", or \"person\" that might reveal details about the person holding a book.\n4. Specifically search for any content mentioning a book or the author of the book the person is holding by trying keywords like \"book\" or \"author\" to determine if the museum record provides this detail.\n5. If the museum record does not supply sufficient information on the book or the subject\u2019s biography, plan to conduct an external web search using the subject's name (if available) along with keywords such as \"book\" and \"author\" to gather supplementary biographical data.\n6. Integrate all gathered information into a final comprehensive answer consisting of: \n   - A short version summing up the title, brief description, and any identified biographical data (or noting if key details are missing).\n   - An extremely detailed version with extracted text from the museum record, explanation of what information is available (or not available) about the subject and the book held, and any supplementary insights.\n   - Additional context describing search limitations or next steps if the museum record does not yield full details.\n\n\n```",

Confirm that the museum record belongs to accession number 2022.128 by reviewing the current webpage and verifying metadata (i.e. the artwork title, medium, dimensions, and purchase details).\\n2. Use search techniques (e.g., the find_on_page tool) to locate additional sections on the page containing a detailed description of the photograph.\\n3. Search for any curatorial or narrative text providing biographical information about the subject of the photograph, with attention to keywords such as \\\"bio\\\", \\\"biographical\\\", \\\"subject\\\", or \\\"person\\\" that might reveal details about the person holding a book.\\n4. Specifically search for any content mentioning a book or the author of the book the person is holding by trying keywords like \\\"book\\\" or \\\"author\\\" to determine if the museum record provides this detail.\\n5. If the museum record does not supply sufficient information on the book or the subject\u2019s biography, plan to conduct an external web search using the subject's name (if available) along with keywords such as \\\"book\\\" and \\\"author\\\" to gather supplementary biographical data.\\n6. Integrate all gathered information into a final comprehensive answer consisting of: \\n   - A short version summing up the title, brief description, and any identified biographical data (or noting if key details are missing).\\n   - An extremely detailed version with extracted text from the museum record, explanation of what information is available (or not available) about the subject and the book held, and any supplementary insights.\\n   - Additional context describing search limitations or next steps if the museum record does not yield full details.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_4lCwqHkDv6f68DTggA4B0yRs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'Biography'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_4lCwqHkDv6f68DTggA4B0yRs\\nObservation:\\nAddress: https://whitney.org/collection/works/65848\\nViewport position: Showing page 1 of 14.\\n=======================\\nThe search string 'Biography' was not found on this page.\"}]}], \"stop_sequences\": [\"Observation:\"], \"grammar\": null, \"tools_to_call_from\": [\"<scripts.text_web_browser.SearchInformationTool object at 0x1155468d0>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.VisitTool object at 0x115567890>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.PageUpTool object at 0x1155236d0>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.PageDownTool object at 0x1145d5dd0>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.FinderTool object at 0x115566190>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.FindNextTool object at 0x1145d5ad0>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.ArchiveSearchTool object at 0x115566590>\", \"<scripts.text_inspector_tool.TextInspectorTool object at 0x1145d6a50>\", \"<smolagents.default_tools.FinalAnswerTool object at 0x11552ed50>\"], \"kwargs\": {}}",

Facts that we have learned  \n\u2022 The museum record page we accessed (work number 65848) belongs to Buck Ellison\u2019s work titled \u201cBuck Ellison | Rain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003.\u201d  \n\u2022 The artwork\u2019s dimensions and medium are provided (an inkjet print on sheet measuring 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. or 101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm).  \n\u2022 The record indicates that the work was purchased with funds from the Photography Committee under accession number 2022.128.  \n\u2022 A search on the page for the specific term \u201cbook held\u201d did not return any immediate results, suggesting that details about a book the person is holding may not be explicitly mentioned in the visible text.  \n\u2022 There have been technical issues when attempting to scroll down the page using the \"page_down\" tool, so not all parts of the webpage have been reviewed yet.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n3.

Facts still to derive  \n\u2022 A clear extraction of the title as officially given by the museum record (beyond the metadata).  \n\u2022 A complete, detailed description of the photograph as provided by the museum\u2019s record.  \n\u2022 A synthesized biography of the person depicted (if available) using all the provided information, particularly focusing on identifying details regarding the author of the book they are holding.  \n\u2022 Logical deductions or integrations of supplementary details, if needed, to fill in gaps about the book\u2019s author if the museum record itself lacks explicit information.\n\nThis updated list of facts forms the foundation for further investigation and answering the manager\u2019s task comprehensively.\n```",

Use search techniques (e.g., the find_on_page tool) to locate additional sections on the page containing a detailed description of the photograph.\n3. Search for any curatorial or narrative text providing biographical information about the subject of the photograph, with attention to keywords such as \"bio\", \"biographical\", \"subject\", or \"person\" that might reveal details about the person holding a book.\n4. Specifically search for any content mentioning a book or the author of the book the person is holding by trying keywords like \"book\" or \"author\" to determine if the museum record provides this detail.\n5. If the museum record does not supply sufficient information on the book or the subject\u2019s biography, plan to conduct an external web search using the subject's name (if available) along with keywords such as \"book\" and \"author\" to gather supplementary biographical data.\n6. Integrate all gathered information into a final comprehensive answer consisting of: \n   - A short version summing up the title, brief description, and any identified biographical data (or noting if key details are missing).\n   - An extremely detailed version with extracted text from the museum record, explanation of what information is available (or not available) about the subject and the book held, and any supplementary insights.\n   - Additional context describing search limitations or next steps if the museum record does not yield full details.\n\n\n```",

Facts still to look up  \\n\u2022 Whether further down on the museum record webpage there is additional narrative or curatorial text that includes a detailed description of the photograph.  \\n\u2022 Additional biographical information regarding the person shown in the photograph\u2014if it exists on this page or via links from the record.  \\n\u2022 Specific details that mention or describe the book held by the person, including any direct reference that identifies the author of that book.  \\n\u2022 If the webpage itself does not contain the needed details, it may be necessary to consult external sources or related scholarly resources for more comprehensive biographical data or exhibition catalog information.\\n\\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \\n4. Facts still to derive  \\n\u2022 A clear extraction of the title as officially given by the museum record (beyond the metadata).  \\n\u2022 A complete, detailed description of the photograph as provided by the museum\u2019s record.  \\n\u2022 A synthesized biography of the person depicted (if available) using all the provided information, particularly focusing on identifying details regarding the author of the book they are holding.  \\n\u2022 Logical deductions or integrations of supplementary details, if needed, to fill in gaps about the book\u2019s author if the museum record itself lacks explicit information.\\n\\nThis updated list of facts forms the foundation for further investigation and answering the manager\u2019s task comprehensively.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nI still need to solve the task I was given:\\n```\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease provide the detailed museum record for the photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.

Confirm that the museum record belongs to accession number 2022.128 by reviewing the current webpage and verifying metadata (i.e. the artwork title, medium, dimensions, and purchase details).\\n2. Use search techniques (e.g., the find_on_page tool) to locate additional sections on the page containing a detailed description of the photograph.\\n3. Search for any curatorial or narrative text providing biographical information about the subject of the photograph, with attention to keywords such as \\\"bio\\\", \\\"biographical\\\", \\\"subject\\\", or \\\"person\\\" that might reveal details about the person holding a book.\\n4. Specifically search for any content mentioning a book or the author of the book the person is holding by trying keywords like \\\"book\\\" or \\\"author\\\" to determine if the museum record provides this detail.\\n5. If the museum record does not supply sufficient information on the book or the subject\u2019s biography, plan to conduct an external web search using the subject's name (if available) along with keywords such as \\\"book\\\" and \\\"author\\\" to gather supplementary biographical data.\\n6. Integrate all gathered information into a final comprehensive answer consisting of: \\n   - A short version summing up the title, brief description, and any identified biographical data (or noting if key details are missing).\\n   - An extremely detailed version with extracted text from the museum record, explanation of what information is available (or not available) about the subject and the book held, and any supplementary insights.\\n   - Additional context describing search limitations or next steps if the museum record does not yield full details.\\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_4lCwqHkDv6f68DTggA4B0yRs', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'Biography'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_4lCwqHkDv6f68DTggA4B0yRs\\nObservation:\\nAddress: https://whitney.org/collection/works/65848\\nViewport position: Showing page 1 of 14.\\n=======================\\nThe search string 'Biography' was not found on this page.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_64sr9ZQKoxMrpdv50ABwszwL', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'find_on_page_ctrl_f', 'arguments': {'search_string': 'holding'}}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-response\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_64sr9ZQKoxMrpdv50ABwszwL\\nObservation:\\nAddress: https://whitney.org/collection/works/65848\\nViewport position: Showing page 8 of 14.\\n=======================\\npm</a>\\n\\n      <div class=\\\"nav-actions nav-actions--small\\\">\\n          <a class=\\\"nav-actions__link\\\" href=\\\"https://transact.whitney.org/general-admission?date=4-9-2025\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"nav-actions__link-inner btn btn--black animated-btn\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"animated-btn__inner\\\">\\n          <div>Book Tickets</div>\\n          <div>Amy Sherald</div>\\n          <div></div>\\n          <div>Book Tickets</div>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n</a>\\n\\n  <a class=\\\"nav-actions__link\\\" href=\\\"/memberships\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"nav-actions__link-inner btn\\\">\\n      Become a member\\n    </div>\\n</a>\\n\\n      </div>\\n    </dialog>\\n  </div>\\n</header>\\n\\n  <main id=\\\"main\\\" class=\\\"main content-wrapper\\\">\\n\\n    <nav class=\\\"breadcrumbs-wrapper\\\" aria-label=\\\"Breadcrumbs\\\">\\n  <ol class=\\\"breadcrumbs\\\">\\n      <li class=\\\"breadcrumbs__item\\\">\\n        <a class=\\\"breadcrumbs__link body-medium btn btn--icon-only arrow-link arrow-link--left\\\" href=\\\"/collection/works\\\">Collection</a>\\n      </li>\\n  </ol>\\n</nav>\\n\\n    <article>\\n  <div class=\\\"collection-detail\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"artwork-label\\\">\\n      <div class=\\\"artwork-label__title\\\">\\n  <h2 class=\\\"body-large-bold m-0\\\">\\n    <a class=\\\"artwork-label__name\\\" href=\\\"/artists/19866\\\">Buck Ellison</a>\\n  </h2>\\n\\n  <h1 class=\\\"body-large m-0\\\">\\n    <em>Rain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003</em>\\n  </h1>\\n\\n    <h3 class=\\\"body-large m-0\\\">\\n      2021\\n    </h3>\\n</div>\\n\\n      <!--          <div class=\\\"artwork-label__description body-large\\\">-->\\n      <!--          </div>-->\\n\\n      <div class=\\\"artwork-label__image\\\">\\n          <figure>\\n    <div class=\\\"overlay-preview-wrapper\\\" data-gallery=\\\"65848\\\">\\n  <a class=\\\"overlay-preview\\\" aria-label=\\\"Lightbox\\\" href=\\\"#\\\">\\n    <img class=\\\"image image--collection\\\" alt=\\\"Man in a denim shirt lies on a rug, holding a book titled &quot;On War&quot; by Carl von Clausewitz.

Task outcome (short version):\nCarl von Clausewitz\u2019s illustrious military career featured a key moment in 1813 when he joined Russian-German Legion, a significant unit in his service record.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nCarl von Clausewitz (1780\u20131831) was a prominent Prussian general and military theorist whose career spanned numerous military campaigns and roles that deeply influenced modern strategic thought. Beginning his military journey at an early age, he entered the Prussian Army as a cadet and later honed his skills at Berlin\u2019s War College. His formative experiences during the tumultuous Napoleonic Wars not only provided him with practical combat and staff experience but also laid the foundation for his later theoretical contributions, most notably encapsulated in his seminal work \"On War\". In 1813, during a period of intense military conflict, Clausewitz joined Russian-German Legion. It was in this critical phase of his career, marked by shifting allegiances and the dynamic context of the Napoleonic campaigns, that his service within Russian-German Legion played a pivotal role. This unit provided him with unique insights into coalition warfare and the interplay between political objectives and military operations, factors that would later resonate through his military writings and enduring legacy as a strategist.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nClausewitz\u2019s experiences across different military structures, including his time in the Russian-German Legion, underscored the complexities of the early nineteenth-century European warfare landscape. His career trajectory, characterized by both practical battlefield engagement and theoretical reflection, continues to inspire military studies and strategic planning. His work remains a cornerstone in understanding the nature of war, the importance of clear strategic thought, and the evolving nature of military leadership.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease provide detailed biographical information on Carl von Clausewitz with emphasis on his military career.

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nCarl von Clausewitz\u2019s illustrious military career featured a key moment in 1813 when he joined Russian-German Legion, a significant unit in his service record.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nCarl von Clausewitz (1780\u20131831) was a prominent Prussian general and military theorist whose career spanned numerous military campaigns and roles that deeply influenced modern strategic thought. Beginning his military journey at an early age, he entered the Prussian Army as a cadet and later honed his skills at Berlin\u2019s War College. His formative experiences during the tumultuous Napoleonic Wars not only provided him with practical combat and staff experience but also laid the foundation for his later theoretical contributions, most notably encapsulated in his seminal work \"On War\". In 1813, during a period of intense military conflict, Clausewitz joined Russian-German Legion. It was in this critical phase of his career, marked by shifting allegiances and the dynamic context of the Napoleonic campaigns, that his service within Russian-German Legion played a pivotal role. This unit provided him with unique insights into coalition warfare and the interplay between political objectives and military operations, factors that would later resonate through his military writings and enduring legacy as a strategist.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nClausewitz\u2019s experiences across different military structures, including his time in the Russian-German Legion, underscored the complexities of the early nineteenth-century European warfare landscape. His career trajectory, characterized by both practical battlefield engagement and theoretical reflection, continues to inspire military studies and strategic planning. His work remains a cornerstone in understanding the nature of war, the importance of clear strategic thought, and the evolving nature of military leadership.\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>\nLast output from code snippet:\nNone",

If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'requests', 'sympy', 'bs4', 'json', 'scipy', 'csv', 'numpy', 'yahoo_finance', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'pandas', 'statistics', 'pptx', 'io', 'itertools', 'queue', 'zipfile', 'Bio', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'os', 'fractions', 'pydub', 're', 'unicodedata', 'stat', 'pubchempy', 'collections', 'time', 'chess', 'torch', 'random']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nWhile the museum record is detailed in terms of artwork specifications (title, medium, dimensions, edition, and credit), it does not include an extended biography of the individual depicted in the photograph aside from the visual description provided in the alt text. The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d). For more extensive biographical data on either Buck Ellison (the artist) or the subject, one may need to refer to additional resources or the artist\u2019s linked biography; however, as far as the museum record is concerned, the above comprises all the available relevant information.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"New task:\\\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nPlease provide the detailed museum record for the photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\\\\\nThe record, as presented on the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s website, gives the following details:\\\\\\\\n\u2022 Title: \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003\u201d (displayed in the headline, with the artist\u2019s name, Buck Ellison, linked on the page).\\\\\\\\n\u2022 Date and Medium: The work is catalogued as a 2021 inkjet print. Its dimensions are noted as \u201cSheet: 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. (101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm)\u201d with the image itself matching these dimensions.\\\\\\\\n\u2022 Accession Number & Edition: Accession number 2022.128 is clearly listed along with an edition note (1/5 | 2AP).

He is holding a book, and the alt text precisely states that the book is titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\\\\\\\\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\\\\\nWhile the museum record is detailed in terms of artwork specifications (title, medium, dimensions, edition, and credit), it does not include an extended biography of the individual depicted in the photograph aside from the visual description provided in the alt text. The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d).

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'requests', 'sympy', 'bs4', 'json', 'scipy', 'csv', 'numpy', 'yahoo_finance', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'pandas', 'statistics', 'pptx', 'io', 'itertools', 'queue', 'zipfile', 'Bio', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'os', 'fractions', 'pydub', 're', 'unicodedata', 'stat', 'pubchempy', 'collections', 'time', 'chess', 'torch', 'random']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Task outcome (short version):\nThe museum record for accession number 2022.128 is a photograph by Buck Ellison titled \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003.\u201d The image shows a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug, holding a book titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. \n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nThe record, as presented on the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s website, gives the following details:\n\u2022 Title: \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003\u201d (displayed in the headline, with the artist\u2019s name, Buck Ellison, linked on the page).\n\u2022 Date and Medium: The work is catalogued as a 2021 inkjet print. Its dimensions are noted as \u201cSheet: 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. (101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm)\u201d with the image itself matching these dimensions.\n\u2022 Accession Number & Edition: Accession number 2022.128 is clearly listed along with an edition note (1/5 | 2AP). The credit line indicates that the work was purchased using funds from the Photography Committee at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\n\u2022 Detailed Description (from the image alt text): The photograph depicts a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug. He is holding a book, and the alt text precisely states that the book is titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nWhile the museum record is detailed in terms of artwork specifications (title, medium, dimensions, edition, and credit), it does not include an extended biography of the individual depicted in the photograph aside from the visual description provided in the alt text. The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d). For more extensive biographical data on either Buck Ellison (the artist) or the subject, one may need to refer to additional resources or the artist\u2019s linked biography; however, as far as the museum record is concerned, the above comprises all the available relevant information.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease provide the detailed museum record for the photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.

In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\\\\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \\\\n\\\\n### 3.

The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d).

Task outcome (short version):\nCarl von Clausewitz\u2019s illustrious military career featured a key moment in 1813 when he joined Russian-German Legion, a significant unit in his service record.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nCarl von Clausewitz (1780\u20131831) was a prominent Prussian general and military theorist whose career spanned numerous military campaigns and roles that deeply influenced modern strategic thought. Beginning his military journey at an early age, he entered the Prussian Army as a cadet and later honed his skills at Berlin\u2019s War College. His formative experiences during the tumultuous Napoleonic Wars not only provided him with practical combat and staff experience but also laid the foundation for his later theoretical contributions, most notably encapsulated in his seminal work \"On War\". In 1813, during a period of intense military conflict, Clausewitz joined Russian-German Legion. It was in this critical phase of his career, marked by shifting allegiances and the dynamic context of the Napoleonic campaigns, that his service within Russian-German Legion played a pivotal role. This unit provided him with unique insights into coalition warfare and the interplay between political objectives and military operations, factors that would later resonate through his military writings and enduring legacy as a strategist.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nClausewitz\u2019s experiences across different military structures, including his time in the Russian-German Legion, underscored the complexities of the early nineteenth-century European warfare landscape. His career trajectory, characterized by both practical battlefield engagement and theoretical reflection, continues to inspire military studies and strategic planning. His work remains a cornerstone in understanding the nature of war, the importance of clear strategic thought, and the evolving nature of military leadership.",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'requests', 'sympy', 'bs4', 'json', 'scipy', 'csv', 'numpy', 'yahoo_finance', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'pandas', 'statistics', 'pptx', 'io', 'itertools', 'queue', 'zipfile', 'Bio', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'os', 'fractions', 'pydub', 're', 'unicodedata', 'stat', 'pubchempy', 'collections', 'time', 'chess', 'torch', 'random']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou have one question to answer.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nThe record, as presented on the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s website, gives the following details:\\n\u2022 Title: \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003\u201d (displayed in the headline, with the artist\u2019s name, Buck Ellison, linked on the page).\\n\u2022 Date and Medium: The work is catalogued as a 2021 inkjet print. Its dimensions are noted as \u201cSheet: 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in.

The credit line indicates that the work was purchased using funds from the Photography Committee at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\\n\u2022 Detailed Description (from the image alt text): The photograph depicts a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug. He is holding a book, and the alt text precisely states that the book is titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nWhile the museum record is detailed in terms of artwork specifications (title, medium, dimensions, edition, and credit), it does not include an extended biography of the individual depicted in the photograph aside from the visual description provided in the alt text. The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d). For more extensive biographical data on either Buck Ellison (the artist) or the subject, one may need to refer to additional resources or the artist\u2019s linked biography; however, as far as the museum record is concerned, the above comprises all the available relevant information.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"New task:\\\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nPlease provide the detailed museum record for the photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'requests', 'sympy', 'bs4', 'json', 'scipy', 'csv', 'numpy', 'yahoo_finance', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'pandas', 'statistics', 'pptx', 'io', 'itertools', 'queue', 'zipfile', 'Bio', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'os', 'fractions', 'pydub', 're', 'unicodedata', 'stat', 'pubchempy', 'collections', 'time', 'chess', 'torch', 'random']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nThe record, as presented on the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s website, gives the following details:\n\u2022 Title: \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003\u201d (displayed in the headline, with the artist\u2019s name, Buck Ellison, linked on the page).\n\u2022 Date and Medium: The work is catalogued as a 2021 inkjet print. Its dimensions are noted as \u201cSheet: 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. (101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm)\u201d with the image itself matching these dimensions.\n\u2022 Accession Number & Edition: Accession number 2022.128 is clearly listed along with an edition note (1/5 | 2AP). The credit line indicates that the work was purchased using funds from the Photography Committee at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\n\u2022 Detailed Description (from the image alt text): The photograph depicts a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug. He is holding a book, and the alt text precisely states that the book is titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nWhile the museum record is detailed in terms of artwork specifications (title, medium, dimensions, edition, and credit), it does not include an extended biography of the individual depicted in the photograph aside from the visual description provided in the alt text. The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d). For more extensive biographical data on either Buck Ellison (the artist) or the subject, one may need to refer to additional resources or the artist\u2019s linked biography; however, as far as the museum record is concerned, the above comprises all the available relevant information.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease provide the detailed museum record for the photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nCarl von Clausewitz (1780\u20131831) was a prominent Prussian general and military theorist whose career spanned numerous military campaigns and roles that deeply influenced modern strategic thought. Beginning his military journey at an early age, he entered the Prussian Army as a cadet and later honed his skills at Berlin\u2019s War College. His formative experiences during the tumultuous Napoleonic Wars not only provided him with practical combat and staff experience but also laid the foundation for his later theoretical contributions, most notably encapsulated in his seminal work \"On War\". In 1813, during a period of intense military conflict, Clausewitz joined Russian-German Legion. It was in this critical phase of his career, marked by shifting allegiances and the dynamic context of the Napoleonic campaigns, that his service within Russian-German Legion played a pivotal role.

Task outcome (short version):\nCarl von Clausewitz joined Russian-German Legion in 1813.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nCarl von Clausewitz (1780\u20131831) was a renowned Prussian general and military theorist whose experiences during the Napoleonic Wars significantly influenced his later work, including his treatise On War. In 1813, during a period of intense military conflict, he joined Russian-German Legion. This military unit, composed of both Russian and German soldiers, played a crucial role in coalition warfare and provided Clausewitz with invaluable experiences that later shaped his military doctrines.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nClausewitz\u2019s tenure in Russian-German Legion is viewed as a turning point in his military career. The insights he gained during his service within this unit\u2014exposure to coalition tactics and the complexities of multinational engagements\u2014are often cited as key influences on his strategic theory, which remains a cornerstone in modern military studies.",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'requests', 'sympy', 'bs4', 'json', 'scipy', 'csv', 'numpy', 'yahoo_finance', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'pandas', 'statistics', 'pptx', 'io', 'itertools', 'queue', 'zipfile', 'Bio', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'os', 'fractions', 'pydub', 're', 'unicodedata', 'stat', 'pubchempy', 'collections', 'time', 'chess', 'torch', 'random']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

Task outcome (short version):\\nThe museum record for accession number 2022.128 is a photograph by Buck Ellison titled \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003.\u201d The image shows a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug, holding a book titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. \\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nThe record, as presented on the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s website, gives the following details:\\n\u2022 Title: \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003\u201d (displayed in the headline, with the artist\u2019s name, Buck Ellison, linked on the page).\\n\u2022 Date and Medium: The work is catalogued as a 2021 inkjet print. Its dimensions are noted as \u201cSheet: 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. (101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm)\u201d with the image itself matching these dimensions.\\n\u2022 Accession Number & Edition: Accession number 2022.128 is clearly listed along with an edition note (1/5 | 2AP). The credit line indicates that the work was purchased using funds from the Photography Committee at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\\n\u2022 Detailed Description (from the image alt text): The photograph depicts a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug. He is holding a book, and the alt text precisely states that the book is titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nWhile the museum record is detailed in terms of artwork specifications (title, medium, dimensions, edition, and credit), it does not include an extended biography of the individual depicted in the photograph aside from the visual description provided in the alt text. The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d). For more extensive biographical data on either Buck Ellison (the artist) or the subject, one may need to refer to additional resources or the artist\u2019s linked biography; however, as far as the museum record is concerned, the above comprises all the available relevant information.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"New task:\\\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nPlease provide the detailed museum record for the photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'requests', 'sympy', 'bs4', 'json', 'scipy', 'csv', 'numpy', 'yahoo_finance', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'pandas', 'statistics', 'pptx', 'io', 'itertools', 'queue', 'zipfile', 'Bio', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'os', 'fractions', 'pydub', 're', 'unicodedata', 'stat', 'pubchempy', 'collections', 'time', 'chess', 'torch', 'random']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Task outcome (short version):\nThe museum record for accession number 2022.128 is a photograph by Buck Ellison titled \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003.\u201d The image shows a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug, holding a book titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. \n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nThe record, as presented on the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s website, gives the following details:\n\u2022 Title: \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003\u201d (displayed in the headline, with the artist\u2019s name, Buck Ellison, linked on the page).\n\u2022 Date and Medium: The work is catalogued as a 2021 inkjet print. Its dimensions are noted as \u201cSheet: 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. (101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm)\u201d with the image itself matching these dimensions.\n\u2022 Accession Number & Edition: Accession number 2022.128 is clearly listed along with an edition note (1/5 | 2AP). The credit line indicates that the work was purchased using funds from the Photography Committee at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\n\u2022 Detailed Description (from the image alt text): The photograph depicts a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug. He is holding a book, and the alt text precisely states that the book is titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nWhile the museum record is detailed in terms of artwork specifications (title, medium, dimensions, edition, and credit), it does not include an extended biography of the individual depicted in the photograph aside from the visual description provided in the alt text. The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d). For more extensive biographical data on either Buck Ellison (the artist) or the subject, one may need to refer to additional resources or the artist\u2019s linked biography; however, as far as the museum record is concerned, the above comprises all the available relevant information.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease provide the detailed museum record for the photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nCarl von Clausewitz (1780\u20131831) was a prominent Prussian general and military theorist whose career spanned numerous military campaigns and roles that deeply influenced modern strategic thought. Beginning his military journey at an early age, he entered the Prussian Army as a cadet and later honed his skills at Berlin\u2019s War College. His formative experiences during the tumultuous Napoleonic Wars not only provided him with practical combat and staff experience but also laid the foundation for his later theoretical contributions, most notably encapsulated in his seminal work \"On War\". In 1813, during a period of intense military conflict, Clausewitz joined Russian-German Legion. It was in this critical phase of his career, marked by shifting allegiances and the dynamic context of the Napoleonic campaigns, that his service within Russian-German Legion played a pivotal role.

Task outcome (short version):\\nThe museum record for accession number 2022.128 is a photograph by Buck Ellison titled \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003.\u201d The image shows a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug, holding a book titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. \\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nThe record, as presented on the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s website, gives the following details:\\n\u2022 Title: \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003\u201d (displayed in the headline, with the artist\u2019s name, Buck Ellison, linked on the page).\\n\u2022 Date and Medium: The work is catalogued as a 2021 inkjet print. Its dimensions are noted as \u201cSheet: 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. (101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm)\u201d with the image itself matching these dimensions.\\n\u2022 Accession Number & Edition: Accession number 2022.128 is clearly listed along with an edition note (1/5 | 2AP). The credit line indicates that the work was purchased using funds from the Photography Committee at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\\n\u2022 Detailed Description (from the image alt text): The photograph depicts a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug. He is holding a book, and the alt text precisely states that the book is titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nWhile the museum record is detailed in terms of artwork specifications (title, medium, dimensions, edition, and credit), it does not include an extended biography of the individual depicted in the photograph aside from the visual description provided in the alt text. The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d). For more extensive biographical data on either Buck Ellison (the artist) or the subject, one may need to refer to additional resources or the artist\u2019s linked biography; however, as far as the museum record is concerned, the above comprises all the available relevant information.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"New task:\\\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nPlease provide the detailed museum record for the photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nCarl von Clausewitz (1780\u20131831) was a prominent Prussian general and military theorist whose career spanned numerous military campaigns and roles that deeply influenced modern strategic thought.

His formative experiences during the tumultuous Napoleonic Wars not only provided him with practical combat and staff experience but also laid the foundation for his later theoretical contributions, most notably encapsulated in his seminal work \\\"On War\\\". In 1813, during a period of intense military conflict, Clausewitz joined Russian-German Legion. It was in this critical phase of his career, marked by shifting allegiances and the dynamic context of the Napoleonic campaigns, that his service within Russian-German Legion played a pivotal role.

Task outcome (short version):\nThe museum record for accession number 2022.128 is a photograph by Buck Ellison titled \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003.\u201d The image shows a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug, holding a book titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. \n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nThe record, as presented on the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s website, gives the following details:\n\u2022 Title: \u201cRain in Rifle Season, Distributions from Split-Interest Trusts, Price Includes Uniform, Never Hit Soft, 2003\u201d (displayed in the headline, with the artist\u2019s name, Buck Ellison, linked on the page).\n\u2022 Date and Medium: The work is catalogued as a 2021 inkjet print. Its dimensions are noted as \u201cSheet: 40 \u00d7 53 1/4 in. (101.6 \u00d7 135.3 cm)\u201d with the image itself matching these dimensions.\n\u2022 Accession Number & Edition: Accession number 2022.128 is clearly listed along with an edition note (1/5 | 2AP). The credit line indicates that the work was purchased using funds from the Photography Committee at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\n\u2022 Detailed Description (from the image alt text): The photograph depicts a man in a denim shirt lying on a rug. He is holding a book, and the alt text precisely states that the book is titled \u201cOn War\u201d by Carl von Clausewitz. In the composition, additional details like a green cap and moccasin nearby help set the scene.\n\u2022 Biographical Information about the Subject: The museum record does not provide an extended biography of the man pictured; however, the significant identifier regarding the book is the title and authorship. From the alt text, we know that the author of the book held by the subject is Carl von Clausewitz, the renowned military theorist. No further biographical details about the subject (the man in the photograph) are provided within this record. \n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nWhile the museum record is detailed in terms of artwork specifications (title, medium, dimensions, edition, and credit), it does not include an extended biography of the individual depicted in the photograph aside from the visual description provided in the alt text. The critical piece of biographical identification requested\u2014the author of the book\u2014is clearly mentioned as Carl von Clausewitz (through the book title \u201cOn War\u201d). For more extensive biographical data on either Buck Ellison (the artist) or the subject, one may need to refer to additional resources or the artist\u2019s linked biography; however, as far as the museum record is concerned, the above comprises all the available relevant information.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease provide the detailed museum record for the photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s collection with accession number 2022.128.

Task outcome (short version):\nCarl von Clausewitz\u2019s illustrious military career featured a key moment in 1813 when he joined Russian-German Legion, a significant unit in his service record.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nCarl von Clausewitz (1780\u20131831) was a prominent Prussian general and military theorist whose career spanned numerous military campaigns and roles that deeply influenced modern strategic thought. Beginning his military journey at an early age, he entered the Prussian Army as a cadet and later honed his skills at Berlin\u2019s War College. His formative experiences during the tumultuous Napoleonic Wars not only provided him with practical combat and staff experience but also laid the foundation for his later theoretical contributions, most notably encapsulated in his seminal work \"On War\". In 1813, during a period of intense military conflict, Clausewitz joined Russian-German Legion. It was in this critical phase of his career, marked by shifting allegiances and the dynamic context of the Napoleonic campaigns, that his service within Russian-German Legion played a pivotal role. This unit provided him with unique insights into coalition warfare and the interplay between political objectives and military operations, factors that would later resonate through his military writings and enduring legacy as a strategist.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nClausewitz\u2019s experiences across different military structures, including his time in the Russian-German Legion, underscored the complexities of the early nineteenth-century European warfare landscape. His career trajectory, characterized by both practical battlefield engagement and theoretical reflection, continues to inspire military studies and strategic planning. His work remains a cornerstone in understanding the nature of war, the importance of clear strategic thought, and the evolving nature of military leadership.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease provide detailed biographical information on Carl von Clausewitz with emphasis on his military career.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nCarl von Clausewitz (1780\u20131831) was a prominent Prussian general and military theorist whose career spanned numerous military campaigns and roles that deeply influenced modern strategic thought. Beginning his military journey at an early age, he entered the Prussian Army as a cadet and later honed his skills at Berlin\u2019s War College. His formative experiences during the tumultuous Napoleonic Wars not only provided him with practical combat and staff experience but also laid the foundation for his later theoretical contributions, most notably encapsulated in his seminal work \"On War\". In 1813, during a period of intense military conflict, Clausewitz joined Russian-German Legion. It was in this critical phase of his career, marked by shifting allegiances and the dynamic context of the Napoleonic campaigns, that his service within Russian-German Legion played a pivotal role. This unit provided him with unique insights into coalition warfare and the interplay between political objectives and military operations, factors that would later resonate through his military writings and enduring legacy as a strategist.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nClausewitz\u2019s experiences across different military structures, including his time in the Russian-German Legion, underscored the complexities of the early nineteenth-century European warfare landscape. His career trajectory, characterized by both practical battlefield engagement and theoretical reflection, continues to inspire military studies and strategic planning. His work remains a cornerstone in understanding the nature of war, the importance of clear strategic thought, and the evolving nature of military leadership.\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>\nLast output from code snippet:\nNone",
