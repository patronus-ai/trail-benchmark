Facts to look up\n\u2022 The detailed data from the NCATS PubChem compound database for Food Additive Status classification.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Source: The PubChem database website and any specific dataset provided on NCATS Food Additive Status classification.  \n\u2022 The exact values or range definitions for \u201ccomplexity\u201d as used in the database to ensure the compound\u2019s complexity falls between 10 and 15.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Source: PubChem documentation or NCATS dataset metadata.  \n\u2022 The list of compounds that meet the molecular weight (\u2264100 g/mol), heavy atoms (=6), and hydrogen bond acceptor (\u22641) criteria.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Source: Query results from the PubChem database.  \n\u2022 The details of the two enzyme transformations related to the identified compound, and the associated gene-chemical co-occurrence data.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Source: The dataset(s) or publication(s) describing enzyme transformations and gene-chemical co-occurrences in the context of food additives, potentially available within NCATS resources or linked references within the PubChem entries.  \n\u2022 The molecular weights of the compounds within the shared gene-chemical co-occurrences to identify which is the heaviest.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Source: Chemical property data from the PubChem entries for each compound.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Identify the compound(s) within the NCATS PubChem Food Additive Status classification that satisfy all the specified criteria (molecular weight, heavy atom count, hydrogen bond acceptors, and complexity).  \n\u2022 Among the enzyme transformation data for the identified compound, determine the intersection (shared set) of gene-chemical co-occurrences between its two possible transformations.  \n\u2022 From that shared set, extract and compare the molecular weights of the involved compounds.  \n\u2022 Derive the PubChem CID of the compound that has the highest molecular weight (the heaviest) in that shared set.\n```\n\nNow begin!

DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['os', 'datetime', 'queue', 'random', 'csv', 'unicodedata', 'math', 'json', 'pptx', 're', 'Bio', 'stat', 'xml', 'sklearn', 'time', 'itertools', 'collections', 'zipfile', 'bs4', 'pydub', 'pandas', 'numpy', 'io', 'torch', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'PIL', 'chess', 'requests', 'PyPDF2', 'fractions', 'statistics', 'sympy', 'pubchempy']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search!

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['os', 'datetime', 'queue', 'random', 'csv', 'unicodedata', 'math', 'json', 'pptx', 're', 'Bio', 'stat', 'xml', 'sklearn', 'time', 'itertools', 'collections', 'zipfile', 'bs4', 'pydub', 'pandas', 'numpy', 'io', 'torch', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'PIL', 'chess', 'requests', 'PyPDF2', 'fractions', 'statistics', 'sympy', 'pubchempy']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task focuses on the NCATS PubChem compound database specifically used for Food Additive Status classification.  \n\u2022 The compound of interest must satisfy several criteria: a molecular weight of 100 g/mol or less, exactly 6 heavy atoms, 1 or fewer hydrogen bond acceptors, and a complexity between 10 and 15.  \n\u2022 The compound in question has two possible enzyme transformations.  \n\u2022 There are shared gene-chemical co-occurrences between these two enzyme transformations.  \n\u2022 The final answer must be the PubChem CID of the heaviest (by molecular weight) compound among those shared co-occurrences.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The detailed data from the NCATS PubChem compound database for Food Additive Status classification.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Source: The PubChem database website and any specific dataset provided on NCATS Food Additive Status classification.  \n\u2022 The exact values or range definitions for \u201ccomplexity\u201d as used in the database to ensure the compound\u2019s complexity falls between 10 and 15.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Source: PubChem documentation or NCATS dataset metadata.  \n\u2022 The list of compounds that meet the molecular weight (\u2264100 g/mol), heavy atoms (=6), and hydrogen bond acceptor (\u22641) criteria.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Source: Query results from the PubChem database.  \n\u2022 The details of the two enzyme transformations related to the identified compound, and the associated gene-chemical co-occurrence data.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Source: The dataset(s) or publication(s) describing enzyme transformations and gene-chemical co-occurrences in the context of food additives, potentially available within NCATS resources or linked references within the PubChem entries.  \n\u2022 The molecular weights of the compounds within the shared gene-chemical co-occurrences to identify which is the heaviest.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Source: Chemical property data from the PubChem entries for each compound.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Identify the compound(s) within the NCATS PubChem Food Additive Status classification that satisfy all the specified criteria (molecular weight, heavy atom count, hydrogen bond acceptors, and complexity).  \n\u2022 Among the enzyme transformation data for the identified compound, determine the intersection (shared set) of gene-chemical co-occurrences between its two possible transformations.  \n\u2022 From that shared set, extract and compare the molecular weights of the involved compounds.  \n\u2022 Derive the PubChem CID of the compound that has the highest molecular weight (the heaviest) in that shared set.\n```",
