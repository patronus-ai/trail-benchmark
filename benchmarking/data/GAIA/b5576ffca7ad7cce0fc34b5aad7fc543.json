It is paramount that you provide a correct answer.\nGive it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded.\nRun verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer!\nHere is the task:\nI need to fact-check a citation. This is the citation from the bibliography:\n\nGreetham, David. \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s).\" Textual Cultures: Texts, Contexts, Interpretation, vol. 3 no. 1, 2008, p. 45-46.

If Yes, answer Yes, otherwise, give me the word in my citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).\n```\nYou can leverage these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['Bio', 'os', 'pandas', 'fractions', 're', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'csv', 'stat', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'io', 'PIL', 'pptx', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'chess', 'numpy', 'collections', 'time', 'queue', 'itertools', 'torch', 'sympy', 'PyPDF2', 'json', 'pubchempy', 'unicodedata', 'xml', 'datetime', 'math', 'random', 'zipfile', 'requests']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['Bio', 'os', 'pandas', 'fractions', 're', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'csv', 'stat', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'io', 'PIL', 'pptx', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'chess', 'numpy', 'collections', 'time', 'queue', 'itertools', 'torch', 'sympy', 'PyPDF2', 'json', 'pubchempy', 'unicodedata', 'xml', 'datetime', 'math', 'random', 'zipfile', 'requests']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files.

If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['Bio', 'os', 'pandas', 'fractions', 're', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'csv', 'stat', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'io', 'PIL', 'pptx', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'chess', 'numpy', 'collections', 'time', 'queue', 'itertools', 'torch', 'sympy', 'PyPDF2', 'json', 'pubchempy', 'unicodedata', 'xml', 'datetime', 'math', 'random', 'zipfile', 'requests']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['Bio', 'os', 'pandas', 'fractions', 're', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'csv', 'stat', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'io', 'PIL', 'pptx', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'chess', 'numpy', 'collections', 'time', 'queue', 'itertools', 'torch', 'sympy', 'PyPDF2', 'json', 'pubchempy', 'unicodedata', 'xml', 'datetime', 'math', 'random', 'zipfile', 'requests']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nAfter retrieving and inspecting the PDF version of David Greetham\u2019s \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\" (2008) via Project MUSE (DOI:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44), I specifically examined pages 45\u201346 for the requested phrase. The expected sentence containing \"cloak of print\" was not found. Instead, the text contains a sentence that features the phrase \"veil of print.\" The extracted sentence (noting that pagination may lead to slight breaks in the continuous sentence) is approximately as follows:\n\n\"...scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis\u2010transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\"\n\nThis indicates that there might be a discrepancy between the query and the actual text \u2013 the query mentions \"cloak of print\" while the text uses \"veil of print.\"\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe article discusses complex ideas related to textual criticism and the inherent challenges of authorial interpretation, using metaphors such as the \"veil of print\" to describe the obscuring effect of scribal errors and mis-transmissions. It is possible that the phrase \"cloak of print\" was mistaken for or conflated with the actual metaphor. In conclusion, in the version of the article available on Project MUSE, no sentence contains \"cloak of print,\" and the relevant sentence correctly uses \"veil of print.\"\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'New task:\\nYou\\'re a helpful agent named \\'search_agent\\'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease retrieve the exact sentence from pages 45-46 of David Greetham\\'s article \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\" (2008) on Project MUSE (DOI:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44) that includes the phrase \\'cloak of print\\'.\\n---\\nYou\\'re helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\\n\\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\\n### 1.

Short answer  \\nThere is no sentence that contains the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d in the pages provided. (There is, however, a sentence on pages 45\u201346 that contains \u201cveil of print.\u201d)\\n\\n2. Extremely detailed answer  \\nAfter carefully reviewing pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d (2008) as provided from Project MUSE, no sentence includes the exact phrase \u201ccloak of print.\u201d What does appear in the text is a sentence with the phrase \u201cveil of print.\u201d That sentence reads as follows (with a slight uncertainty about typographical breaks stemming from pagination):  \\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\u201c\u2026scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\u201d  \\n\\nIt appears that the query you posed may be referring to \u201ccloak of print\u201d when the text actually uses \u201cveil of print.\u201d If your intention was indeed to extract a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print,\u201d then unfortunately such a sentence is not found in the provided document. If, however, you meant the sentence with \u201cveil of print,\u201d then the full sentence extends from where \u201cveil of print\u201d appears through the following clause. (Be aware that the sentence might be split over the page break, so in the published version it likely appears as one continuous sentence.)  \\n\\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \\nThe file you provided is an excerpt from David Greetham\u2019s scholarly article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d published in Textual Cultures in Spring 2008 on Project MUSE. The article discusses Greetham\u2019s experiences and evolving approaches in textual criticism and the notion of authorial presence versus absence in editing practices. Your question specifically requested extraction of a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print\u201d from pages 45\u201346. However, after close examination the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d does not occur\u2014instead, the article uses \u201cveil of print\u201d in a sentence that contrasts the surface appearance of text (the \u201cveil of print\u201d) with the underlying \u201cscribal confusion and mis-transmission.\u201d As such, if you intended to refer to that sentence, the answer provided above is what appears in the document; otherwise, there is no sentence matching \u201ccloak of print.\u201d'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': '[FACTS LIST]:\\nHere is the updated list of the facts that I know:\\n```\\nfinal_answer: \\n{\\n  \"1.

Facts that we have learned\": \"\u2022 A Google search and review of available resources indicate that the article does not contain the exact phrase \\'cloak of print\\'.\\\\n\u2022 Instead, on pages 45\u201346 a sentence contains the phrase \\'veil of print\\' (not \\'cloak of print\\').\\\\n\u2022 The extracted sentence (or its fragment) reads approximately as: \\'...scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission.

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nNo sentence on pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article contains the exact phrase \"cloak of print.\" Instead, the text includes a sentence with the phrase \"veil of print.\"\\\\n\\\\n### 2.

The expected sentence containing \"cloak of print\" was not found. Instead, the text contains a sentence that features the phrase \"veil of print.\" The extracted sentence (noting that pagination may lead to slight breaks in the continuous sentence) is approximately as follows:\\\\n\\\\n\"...scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis\u2010transmission.

Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nThe article discusses complex ideas related to textual criticism and the inherent challenges of authorial interpretation, using metaphors such as the \"veil of print\" to describe the obscuring effect of scribal errors and mis-transmissions. It is possible that the phrase \"cloak of print\" was mistaken for or conflated with the actual metaphor. In conclusion, in the version of the article available on Project MUSE, no sentence contains \"cloak of print,\" and the relevant sentence correctly uses \"veil of print.\"\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>\nLast output from code snippet:\nmis\u2011transmission",

DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['Bio', 'os', 'pandas', 'fractions', 're', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'csv', 'stat', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'io', 'PIL', 'pptx', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'chess', 'numpy', 'collections', 'time', 'queue', 'itertools', 'torch', 'sympy', 'PyPDF2', 'json', 'pubchempy', 'unicodedata', 'xml', 'datetime', 'math', 'random', 'zipfile', 'requests']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['Bio', 'os', 'pandas', 'fractions', 're', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'csv', 'stat', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'io', 'PIL', 'pptx', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'chess', 'numpy', 'collections', 'time', 'queue', 'itertools', 'torch', 'sympy', 'PyPDF2', 'json', 'pubchempy', 'unicodedata', 'xml', 'datetime', 'math', 'random', 'zipfile', 'requests']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Task outcome (short version):\nNo sentence on pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article contains the exact phrase \"cloak of print.\" Instead, the text includes a sentence with the phrase \"veil of print.\"\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nAfter retrieving and inspecting the PDF version of David Greetham\u2019s \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\" (2008) via Project MUSE (DOI:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44), I specifically examined pages 45\u201346 for the requested phrase. The expected sentence containing \"cloak of print\" was not found. Instead, the text contains a sentence that features the phrase \"veil of print.\" The extracted sentence (noting that pagination may lead to slight breaks in the continuous sentence) is approximately as follows:\n\n\"...scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis\u2010transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\"\n\nThis indicates that there might be a discrepancy between the query and the actual text \u2013 the query mentions \"cloak of print\" while the text uses \"veil of print.\"\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe article discusses complex ideas related to textual criticism and the inherent challenges of authorial interpretation, using metaphors such as the \"veil of print\" to describe the obscuring effect of scribal errors and mis-transmissions. It is possible that the phrase \"cloak of print\" was mistaken for or conflated with the actual metaphor. In conclusion, in the version of the article available on Project MUSE, no sentence contains \"cloak of print,\" and the relevant sentence correctly uses \"veil of print.\"",

Facts given in the task\n### 2. Facts to look up\n### 3. Facts to derive\nDo not add anything else.\n\nHere is the task:\n```\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\n---\nTask:\nPlease retrieve the exact sentence from pages 45-46 of David Greetham's article \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\" (2008) on Project MUSE (DOI:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44) that includes the phrase 'cloak of print'.\n---\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\n\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\nPut all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.\nAnd even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.You can navigate to .txt online files.\n    If a non-html page is in another format, especially .pdf or a Youtube video, use tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to inspect it.\n    Additionally, if after some searching you find out that you need more information to answer the question, you can use `final_answer` with your request for clarification as argument to request for more information.\n```\nNow begin!",

(There is, however, a sentence on pages 45\u201346 that contains \u201cveil of print.\u201d)\n\n2. Extremely detailed answer  \nAfter carefully reviewing pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d (2008) as provided from Project MUSE, no sentence includes the exact phrase \u201ccloak of print.\u201d What does appear in the text is a sentence with the phrase \u201cveil of print.\u201d That sentence reads as follows (with a slight uncertainty about typographical breaks stemming from pagination):  \n\n\u2003\u2003\u201c\u2026scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\u201d  \n\nIt appears that the query you posed may be referring to \u201ccloak of print\u201d when the text actually uses \u201cveil of print.\u201d If your intention was indeed to extract a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print,\u201d then unfortunately such a sentence is not found in the provided document. If, however, you meant the sentence with \u201cveil of print,\u201d then the full sentence extends from where \u201cveil of print\u201d appears through the following clause. (Be aware that the sentence might be split over the page break, so in the published version it likely appears as one continuous sentence.)  \n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \nThe file you provided is an excerpt from David Greetham\u2019s scholarly article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d published in Textual Cultures in Spring 2008 on Project MUSE. The article discusses Greetham\u2019s experiences and evolving approaches in textual criticism and the notion of authorial presence versus absence in editing practices. Your question specifically requested extraction of a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print\u201d from pages 45\u201346. However, after close examination the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d does not occur\u2014instead, the article uses \u201cveil of print\u201d in a sentence that contrasts the surface appearance of text (the \u201cveil of print\u201d) with the underlying \u201cscribal confusion and mis-transmission.\u201d As such, if you intended to refer to that sentence, the answer provided above is what appears in the document; otherwise, there is no sentence matching \u201ccloak of print.\u201d",

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Perform a web search query (think a google search) and returns the search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The web search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"[Optional parameter]: filter the search results to only include pages from a specific year. For example, '2020' will only include pages from 2020. Make sure to use this parameter if you're trying to search for articles from a specific date!\", 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_page: Visit a webpage at a given URL and return its text. Given a url to a YouTube video, this returns the transcript.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The relative or absolute url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_up: Scroll the viewport UP one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_down: Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_on_page_ctrl_f: Scroll the viewport to the first occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for. Give this date in the format 'YYYYMMDD', for instance '27 June 2008' is written as '20080627'.\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Extremely detailed answer  \nAfter carefully reviewing pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d (2008) as provided from Project MUSE, no sentence includes the exact phrase \u201ccloak of print.\u201d What does appear in the text is a sentence with the phrase \u201cveil of print.\u201d That sentence reads as follows (with a slight uncertainty about typographical breaks stemming from pagination):  \n\n\u2003\u2003\u201c\u2026scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission.

If, however, you meant the sentence with \u201cveil of print,\u201d then the full sentence extends from where \u201cveil of print\u201d appears through the following clause. (Be aware that the sentence might be split over the page break, so in the published version it likely appears as one continuous sentence.)  \n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \nThe file you provided is an excerpt from David Greetham\u2019s scholarly article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d published in Textual Cultures in Spring 2008 on Project MUSE. The article discusses Greetham\u2019s experiences and evolving approaches in textual criticism and the notion of authorial presence versus absence in editing practices. Your question specifically requested extraction of a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print\u201d from pages 45\u201346. However, after close examination the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d does not occur\u2014instead, the article uses \u201cveil of print\u201d in a sentence that contrasts the surface appearance of text (the \u201cveil of print\u201d) with the underlying \u201cscribal confusion and mis-transmission.\u201d As such, if you intended to refer to that sentence, the answer provided above is what appears in the document; otherwise, there is no sentence matching \u201ccloak of print.\u201d",

Describing such devices as the mapping out of a comprehensive series of abstract mod-els for charting the relationships between a translated and a translating text (in the case of John Trevisa) and the construction of an authorial idiolect where no autograph survives (in the case of Thomas Hoccleve), the personal narrative now regards these attempts to reach back into the authorial psyche as hubristic, even improper. In the place of such a single autho-rial identity, the essay concludes by showing how authoriality rather than authorship took over in the development of a scholarly career, resulting in, for example, the founding of the in-terdisciplinary Society for Textual Scholarship. For Speed Hill1I TRIED TO FIND, AND BE LOYAL TO, AN AUTHOR: I REALLY DID. But somehow  the \u201cpsychic connections\u201d that my fellow-panelists identified, never quite took with me. As a very neophyte editor, I was co-opted (suborned?) into the Clarendon Press edition of John Trevisa\u2019s Middle English translation of Bartholomaeus Anglicus\u2019s De Proprietatibus Rerum (On the Properties of Things), or DPR, a \u201cmonumental\u201d tome, published in 1975.2 But Trevisa, while a diligent scholar and even possibly a renegade Wycliffite (or even  1. Since Speed Hill (1935\u20132007) organised these two panels on the psychic relations between editor and author (and also contributed a paper), but was sadly unable to attend the sessions, I dedicate my own paper to him. 2.

Fowler,3 the author of Piers Plowman), re-mained somehow determinedly faceless, basically a faithful translator (and a successful one) of \u201cother men\u2019s flowers\u201d.But I did try, and, to be honest, quite enjoyed the ultimately failed at-tempt, in part because it gave me the opportunity to delve into some of the more arcane areas of textual research (based on this biographical fact of Trevisa\u2019s having devoted himself to translation), and thereby to produce what I now regard as a series of too-neat, too pat, and perhaps also too pre-tentious \u201cmodels\u201d for translation, which Fredson Bowers was generous enough to publish in Studies in Bibliography (see Greetham 1984). I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point now (and besides which, I would probably find it too embarrassing a display of my youthful idealism) to try to actually explicate what these fanciful models mean, ranging as they do from what I called the \u201cPerfect Linear\u201d (in which all witnesses in the translating language are uni-form in using the same, or very similar, term[s] to represent what appears to be an \u201caccurate\u201d translation) to the more complex \u201cParallel Variance Class\u201d (in which we seem to get two or more plausible but inconsistent translations of the original text). I now believe that the very titles of these different translation models sound pretentious, in their attempts to map out every possible relationship between translating and translated text: I think they show my youthful earnestness, my attempts to situate Trevisa and his text as an ideal form to which I could declare allegiance, and thus embrace as a fa-ther figure.4 The models were quite wonderful in their enthusiasm, and were all dedicated to the project of gaining a more direct access to my author, ob- 3. While I had obviously \u201crepressed\u201d this recognition in the oral delivery of this paper, the recent death of David Fowler has brought home to me more forcefully his role as the missing \u201cfather figure\u201d looming in this and other papers in this collection. It was Fowler who read my first meagre publication in a medievalist newsletter mysteri-ously called Ralph, and on the strength of that and subsequent correspondence, in-vited me out to the University of Washington and other west coast institutions to lecture on Trevisa and textual studies. He became one of the first advisers to the So-ciety for Textual Scholarship, a contributor to TEXT and to our conferences, and a continued kindly presence in my early textual life. While this paper is formally ded-icated to Speed Hill, it also commemorates a generation of such scholars (like Fred-son Bowers and Paul Oskar Kristeller) who showed me the textual light before I even acknowledged that was the path I was to take, and continued to be wise, cour-teous, and benevolent mentors till the end of their lives. 4. The models were intended to chart every possible relationship between the trans-lated and translating text, from unambiguous to complex, including various types that would cover not only variance in the witnesses of the translating text and unanimity in the source, but also variance in both source and translation.\\f:\\n\\n)\\nT\\nM\\nG\\n1\\n4\\n7\\n1\\n9\\n1\\n-\\n3\\n0\\n-\\n5\\n2\\n0\\n2\\n(\\n\\nE\\nS\\nU\\nM\\n\\nj\\n\\nt\\nc\\ne\\no\\nr\\nP\\n\\n.\\n\\n6\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n1\\n.\\n4\\n7\\n.\\n0\\n5\\n\\n46 | Textual Cultures 3.1 (2008)scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models. I think I have to recognise that the project was ultimately not as effective at \u201cunveiling\u201d the author as I had hoped and was thus also not enough to endow Trevisa with those paternal qualities I was presumably looking for.But, what was worse, from the mid-seventies or so, and especially after the first two volumes came out in 1975, I began to have second thoughts about the then-dominant editorial principles which we had unconsciously assumed were appropriate to the editing of Trevisa, and began to write a se-ries of essays not setting up an idealised author and an idealised text, but distancing myself both from these essentially Formalist/New Critical princi-ples and at the same time questioning the unexamined hegemony of any ed-itorial/authorial/philosophical protocols that could be employed on any text. This distancing (and embarrassment) has continued down to the pres-ent, for in an article recently published in the Italian textual journal Ecdot-ica, I return again to the scene of the crime and use the personal and cultural distancing as a means of showing just what was then, and what might be now: that the earlier search for an immanent author (mis)represented by the extant, but inevitably corrupt, witnesses, has given way to a recognition that the variance shown in these witnesses is valuable evidence for the so-cialization of the text (Greetham 2006). In this case, my Ecdotica piece, while formally a response to Paul Eggert\u2019s generous and comprehensive re-view-essay (2005) of my Theories of the Text for the same journal, became not just a survey of the changing terrain of textual practice, but a demon-stration of how practice could be affected by theory. And, just as Freud bravely used his own dreams and his own \u201cFreudian slips\u201d (avant la lettre) in his account of the general phenomena, I was still smarting enough from my earlier unthinking acceptance of the then-dominant ideology to use my own \u201cslips\u201d as examples of what the shift in textual perspective might show.5 This section of the Ecdotica essay demonstrates how a witness that we re-garded as \u201cinsincere\u201d and \u201cinauthentic\u201d in the 1970s (and thus not fixable with any security on any conventional patrilinear stemma, and therefore not \u201cauthentic\u201d or \u201csincere\u201d enough to be cited as evidence of an authorial reading) would under the different textual dispensation of a quarter century later now become by far the most challenging and significant, precisely be-cause it showed a copyist/reader actively intervening in the construction of an early \u201csocialised\u201d text. If I were to edit Trevisa now, far from being re- 5.

It all depends where you\u2019re standing.Thus, by the time I came to my second potential father figure, Thomas Hoccleve, I was ready for a more than usually interrogative view of text and author, and this despite the fact that various features in Hoccleve\u2019s life (which, unlike Trevisa, were very well documented not only in contempo-rary records but in the introspective and self-revelatory nature of his own poetry) corresponded to some parts of my own personal narrative (bouts with depression, anxieties about professional status and productivity, and even the ability to write).For example, in the so-called highly autobiographical Series poems (Fur-nIvall and Gollancz [1892] 1970), Hoccleve introduces an interlocutor (\u201cFriend\u201d), who functions much like, say, Dr. Arbuthnot in Pope\u2019s Epistle to the said gentleman: to provoke, to question, to advise:Of studie was engendred thy seeknesse,And \u00feat was hard / woldest [thow] now agayn Entre into \u00feat laborious bisynesse,     Syn it thy mynde and eek thy wit had slayn?  Thy conceit is nat worth payndemayn: Let be / let be / bisye thee so no more Lest thee repente and reewe it ouersore.   (Dialogue, vv. 379\u201385)According to this \u201cFriend\u201d, Hoccleve suffered from an excess of \u201cStudie\u201d and \u201cThought\u201d (like Hamlet\u2019s \u201cthinking too precisely on th\u2019 event\u201d), which made him unable to write\u2014and this is, of course, what he writes about, the inability to write.6 It\u2019s an ironic game of productive non-production that ex-tends through Burton\u2019s Anatomy and beyond. He even had a Lacanian \u201cmir-ror\u201d stage, where he questions his own powers of perception, especially of the state of his own mental illness,7 a technique that Philip Roth was later to use in The Breast (though I would not therefore assert that Roth is a de-voted Hocclevean [see Greetham 1989b): 6. Hoccleve\u2019s line, that the \u201cthoght is wasting seed\u201d, appears in the \u201cPrologue\u201d to the Regiment of Princes; see FurnIvall 1897, 201\u20133. 7. For Hoccleve\u2019s \u201cmirror scene\u201d, see his \u201cComplaint\u201d in FurnIvall and Gollancz [1892] 1970, 162\u201375.\\f:\\n\\n)\\nT\\nM\\nG\\n1\\n4\\n7\\n1\\n9\\n1\\n-\\n3\\n0\\n-\\n5\\n2\\n0\\n2\\n(\\n\\nE\\nS\\nU\\nM\\n\\nj\\n\\nt\\nc\\ne\\no\\nr\\nP\\n\\n.\\n\\n6\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n1\\n.\\n4\\n7\\n.\\n0\\n5\\n\\n48 | Textual Cultures 3.1 (2008)Many a sawte made I to this myrrowre,thinkynge, \u201cyf that I loke in this manereamonge folke / as I now do, none errowrof suspecte loke / may in my face appere,this countinance, I am svre, and this chere,If I forthe vse / is no thinge reprevableTo them that have / conseytes resonableAnd there-with-all I thowgt[e] thus anon:\u201cmen in theyr owne case / bene blynd alday,as I haue hard say / many a day agon,and in that [same] plight / I stonde may;how shall I doo / which is the best[e] waymy trowbled spirit for to bringe at rest[e]?yf I wist howe / fyne wolde I do the best[e]\u201d.  (Complaint, vv. 162\u201375)So Thomas Hoccleve was an attractive figure, one to whom I might in-deed establish a \u201cpsychic connection\u201d, particularly since we both seemed to have \u201cpsychic disjunctions\u201d. And so, perhaps as a replication of my technical \u201cmodelling\u201d for Trevisa as translator, I tried (I really did) to get further back, and closer to, my new author\u2019s actual idiolect than had previously been thought possible for any Middle English author. Surveying the anomalous condition of the Hoccleve oeuvre as it was (or was not) preserved in auto-graph manuscripts (Hoccleve was, after all, a professional scribe), I intro-duced what was at the time a radical editorial procedure: importing the well preserved accidentals of Hoccleve\u2019s own autograph manuscripts of other works into the substantive text of his most famous work, the De Regimine Principum (Regiment of Princes) or DRP, for which no autograph survived.8 Given that Hoccleve was an anally retentive bureaucrat and tried to im-pose order on the shifting surface features of late medieval verse, the edito-rial team, whose personnel varied over the years, found that there was even more consistency in usage in other surviving autographs than we might have hoped for, and that this radical editorial procedure actually worked: a similar modus operandi was later used for one of the texts in the California Twain, where no autographs remained, but accidentals usage could be estab- 8. I began work on this \u201cimporting\u201d of accidentals as a general editor of a new \u201cnor-malised\u201d edition. This editing was eventually completed by Charles R. Blyth (1999). For a description of this editorial procedure, see Greetham 1985 and 1987.\\n\\n\\fDavid Greetham: Uncoupled | 49lished from collateral works.9 But what was doubtless (in retrospect) more significant for me at that second stage of an academic career, was that this attempted penetration into the compositional idiosyncrasies of an other-wise absent author gave me the opportunity to indulge in a new series of ar-cane models, using a computer-generated concordance (we were still on a mainframe in those days) and a reverse concordance. (See Figure 1 and Fig-ure 2). With such evidence analysed we were determined to map out our journey into the author\u2019s mind. This \u201cmapping\u201d was to follow a very prede-termined narrative of editorial choices, as is shown in the \u201cflowchart\u201d in Figure 3. This flowchart began to show some resemblance to the Hampton  9. hIrSt 1993. There is now a \u201crevised\u201d paperback edition (2002) of Roughing It pur-porting to be the \u201cfirst and only text that adheres to the author\u2019s wishes in details of wording, spelling, and punctuation, restored from original sources\u201d, but this is then noted as \u201creproduces the text and notes of the Mark Twain Project\u2019s 1993 edition\u201d.Figure 1 and 2 (below): Example of a reverse concordance for Hoccleve\u2019s De Regimine Principum. A reverse concordance simply lists all words in a lexical data base, but with the spellings in reverse order, so that, as in the examples of Figure 1 and Figure 2, we can see Hoccleve\u2019s use of words with an \u2013is ending and a \u2013ys (two alternative forms for, say, plurals or genitives) and thus hope to discover any authorial preference of consistency during a period when such spellings were not yet fixed. The computer file from which the reverse concordance was drawn was created by the computer services department at Adelphi University under the supervision of Peter Farley.\\f:\\n\\n)\\nT\\nM\\nG\\n1\\n4\\n7\\n1\\n9\\n1\\n-\\n3\\n0\\n-\\n5\\n2\\n0\\n2\\n(\\n\\nE\\nS\\nU\\nM\\n\\nj\\n\\nt\\nc\\ne\\no\\nr\\nP\\n\\n.\\n\\n6\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n1\\n.\\n4\\n7\\n.\\n0\\n5\\n\\n50 | Textual Cultures 3.1 (2008)Court Maze, but (as with the translation \u201cmodels\u201d for Trevisa) was intended to give an editor a theoretical and practical guide to the recovery of autho-rial usage, inferred or otherwise. And, as with the examples of modelling from Trevisa, I don\u2019t now think there would be any great value in trying to explicate these processes, but simply to display them as evidence of textual hubris (and probably pretension as well). But again, stalwart Fredson Bowers happily took this display into the bosom of Studies in Bibliography.10 But having done what at first seemed editorially improper (even after hav-ing received the imprimatur of Fredson Bowers, and through him, by spiritual osmosis, that of W. W. Greg), there remained the nagging question: why was it possible for us to think of this apparently radical approach at one cultural moment and yet not to have questioned the inherited New Critical dogma that lay behind the editing of Trevisa (and, as Lee Patterson [1985] has pointed out, behind the virtually contemporaneous \u201cmodernist\u201d editing of the B Text of Piers Plowman by Kane and Donaldson)? What cultural/intellectual/proce-dural forces (usually unacknowledged, in fact usually invisible), tended to make us more susceptible to one editorial series of donn\u00e9es than another? Was this a case of Althusser\u2019s famous definition of \u201cideology\u201d as something inter-nalised and unseen, whereby a cultural moment established its identity? Or was it an example of Terry Eagleton\u2019s insistence that \u201cideology, like halitosis, is what the other person has\u201d?11 And if this were so, what would that do to the possibility of attaching ourselves psychically to any author, no matter how se- 10.

Did I really want to establish psychic confraternities with the faceless and/or the neurotic and depressed? Or with their opposites, whoever they might be? On a practical level, how much real progress could there be in moving from the monumental DPR (Trevisa), consuming ten years, to the equally monumental DRP (Hocc-leve), another ten? One consonant? And how strong could my own assertions of editorial self-confidence be in embracing either the faceless translator or the depressive poet, a poet who is most often illustrated by that manuscript of the Regiment bearing a portrait of his \u201cmaster\u201d, Chaucer, admonishing him from the margins? And what had it already said about the canonical (and per-sonal) status of Hoccleve, that the previous edition of the Regiment, by Fred Furnivall (1897), had overtly (and to my mind embarrassingly) selected the copy-text for that edition on the manuscript bearing the \u201cbest portrait of Chaucer\u201d, (i.e., of another poet, not the one you\u2019re editing!), even though the linguistic features of this selected copy-text were distinctly inappropriate, with traces of northern forms that would have been unlikely to come from the mouths or pens of either Hoccleve or Chaucer, both Londoners. Hoccleve was also \u201cOccleve\u201d, like a good Cockney.

By this time, I had critically distanced myself from the Formal-ist theory and practice of one edition (Trevisa); and while I was attracted to the psychological self-exposure of another author (Hoccleve), he was in any case gradually beginning to come into his own (as a couple of my \u201ccritical\u201d es-says argued), and I did not wish to hoist my colours to someone who was none-theless still a \u201cminor\u201d author. In the same period of my academic life, I had also come to the realization that there were unseen theoretical precepts driving the apparently \u201cneutral\u201d interventions of editors of the Greg-Bowers-Tanselle dis-pensation, and that these \u201cunseen\u201d precepts could undermine any claim that an editor (or critic) was simply \u201cdoing what comes naturally\u201d. Thus I began to understand that this lofty, while at the same time self-denigrating, principle was untenable historically and procedurally: Donaldon\u2019s acerbic and dismissive prescription (1970) for an \u201ceditorial death-wish\u201d was ironically both hubristic and unattainable. There was only one alternative: to cast myself off from a spe-cific author, or even group of authors (while at the same time maintaining a deep interest and commitment to \u201cauthoriality\u201d), and to begin to explore and make \u201cmanifest\u201d what had previously remained hidden. A scholarly-critical life not without authors, but, if anything, with too many of them. In this different trajectory, I was immensely helped (and inspired) by the work of others: I have already expressed my debt (in, for example, the writ-ing of Textual Transgressions) to the \u201cpersonalist criticism\u201d of my colleague Nancy K. Miller.12 W. Speed Hill provided a constant and reliable sounding-board (and voice of quiet reasonability) for some of my off-the-wall conjec-tures. And the ever-accommodating Fredson Bowers took one of my earlier forays into \u201cediting without an author\u201d into the pages of Studies in Bibliogra-phy, claiming, with a typical Bowersian irony, that a) he didn\u2019t understand a word of it and b) that the following detailed revisions, showing a full aware-ness of the supposedly incomprehensible, would improve the piece: and, of course, he was right.13 And through it all was the looming presence of Je-rome J. McGann and the \u201csocial\u201d theory of textuality, providing further evi-dence that the time was ripe for the sort of \u201cuncoupling\u201d I was embarking upon, even though Jerry had deftly managed to combine his social theory with a new commitment to D. G. Rossetti after an equally enthusiastic com-mitment to Byron, the editing of which he now disavowed. But Jerry is Jerry, and can juggle more balls than the rest of us.14 So the subterranean streams were in part navigated in my Theories of the  12. See reIman 1993 and mIller 1991. 13. I refer to \u201cLiterary and Textual Theory: Redrawing the Matrix\u201d (Greetham 1989a).  14.

Do I envy my fellow-textuists who have found and remained loyal to their authors? Yes, I do recognise that having (almost) found but then lost my author(s) I have shown less stamina and determination and consistency than Speed Hill as Hooker, Don Reiman as Shelley, and Jack Stillinger as Keats (even with his occasional forays into Coleridge). It may be that some would regard my \u201cuncoupling\u201d as a form of dilettantism, an inability to hold fast to one individual, one oeuvre, one authorial presence. I have no persuasive argument to this charge, beyond the fact that at two earlier stages of my career I did at least try to approach and to reconstruct this idealised author, but then backed off. As Speed has re-minded me, even in my partly autobiographical Textual Transgressions (1998) my own biological father is distinctly absent (after all, he was dead by the time I was four months old), and one might then have imagined that my awareness of this familial gap would have made the search for a literary father figure the more psychologically pressing. After many years of therapy, I have yet to es-tablish whether the real-life loss in some way foredoomed the search for a re-placement, but since I have also embraced the marginal status of the alien (and thus feel more drawn to a figure like Auerbach or Kristeller than to com-fortable Trevisa and loony Hoccleve), this marginalisation has had its positive aspects: by looking in from the outside, I believe that this helped me to imag-ine a society in which everyone was to some extent an alien, everyone was made to feel a little less secure about his or her textual principles: in other words, STS and our twenty-eight years of meetings and publications. I\u2019m not convinced that this would have happened if I had not been uncoupled, if I had remained an acolyte of Trevisa or Hoccleve (or of Middle English, for that matter). So, non, je ne regrette rien.Given this retreat from the singularity of both text and author, the con-scious \u201cuncoupling\u201d of my title, is it any wonder that my next book should be a celebration of yet another unholy: its tentative title is The Pleasures of Contamination, with an hommage to Barthes, Cerquiglini, and to the tex-tual jouissance I have always found in the wonderfully \u201ccontaminated\u201d at-mosphere of these STS gatherings.15 City University of New York, Graduate Center 15.

Describing such devices as the mapping out of a comprehensive series of abstract mod-els for charting the relationships between a translated and a translating text (in the case of John Trevisa) and the construction of an authorial idiolect where no autograph survives (in the case of Thomas Hoccleve), the personal narrative now regards these attempts to reach back into the authorial psyche as hubristic, even improper. In the place of such a single autho-rial identity, the essay concludes by showing how authoriality rather than authorship took over in the development of a scholarly career, resulting in, for example, the founding of the in-terdisciplinary Society for Textual Scholarship. For Speed Hill1I TRIED TO FIND, AND BE LOYAL TO, AN AUTHOR: I REALLY DID. But somehow  the \u201cpsychic connections\u201d that my fellow-panelists identified, never quite took with me. As a very neophyte editor, I was co-opted (suborned?) into the Clarendon Press edition of John Trevisa\u2019s Middle English translation of Bartholomaeus Anglicus\u2019s De Proprietatibus Rerum (On the Properties of Things), or DPR, a \u201cmonumental\u201d tome, published in 1975.2 But Trevisa, while a diligent scholar and even possibly a renegade Wycliffite (or even  1.

Fowler,3 the author of Piers Plowman), re-mained somehow determinedly faceless, basically a faithful translator (and a successful one) of \u201cother men\u2019s flowers\u201d.But I did try, and, to be honest, quite enjoyed the ultimately failed at-tempt, in part because it gave me the opportunity to delve into some of the more arcane areas of textual research (based on this biographical fact of Trevisa\u2019s having devoted himself to translation), and thereby to produce what I now regard as a series of too-neat, too pat, and perhaps also too pre-tentious \u201cmodels\u201d for translation, which Fredson Bowers was generous enough to publish in Studies in Bibliography (see Greetham 1984). I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point now (and besides which, I would probably find it too embarrassing a display of my youthful idealism) to try to actually explicate what these fanciful models mean, ranging as they do from what I called the \u201cPerfect Linear\u201d (in which all witnesses in the translating language are uni-form in using the same, or very similar, term[s] to represent what appears to be an \u201caccurate\u201d translation) to the more complex \u201cParallel Variance Class\u201d (in which we seem to get two or more plausible but inconsistent translations of the original text). I now believe that the very titles of these different translation models sound pretentious, in their attempts to map out every possible relationship between translating and translated text: I think they show my youthful earnestness, my attempts to situate Trevisa and his text as an ideal form to which I could declare allegiance, and thus embrace as a fa-ther figure.4 The models were quite wonderful in their enthusiasm, and were all dedicated to the project of gaining a more direct access to my author, ob- 3. While I had obviously \u201crepressed\u201d this recognition in the oral delivery of this paper, the recent death of David Fowler has brought home to me more forcefully his role as the missing \u201cfather figure\u201d looming in this and other papers in this collection. It was Fowler who read my first meagre publication in a medievalist newsletter mysteri-ously called Ralph, and on the strength of that and subsequent correspondence, in-vited me out to the University of Washington and other west coast institutions to lecture on Trevisa and textual studies. He became one of the first advisers to the So-ciety for Textual Scholarship, a contributor to TEXT and to our conferences, and a continued kindly presence in my early textual life. While this paper is formally ded-icated to Speed Hill, it also commemorates a generation of such scholars (like Fred-son Bowers and Paul Oskar Kristeller) who showed me the textual light before I even acknowledged that was the path I was to take, and continued to be wise, cour-teous, and benevolent mentors till the end of their lives. 4. The models were intended to chart every possible relationship between the trans-lated and translating text, from unambiguous to complex, including various types that would cover not only variance in the witnesses of the translating text and unanimity in the source, but also variance in both source and translation.\f:\n\n)\nT\nM\nG\n1\n4\n7\n1\n9\n1\n-\n3\n0\n-\n5\n2\n0\n2\n(\n\nE\nS\nU\nM\n\nj\n\nt\nc\ne\no\nr\nP\n\n.\n\n6\n2\n2\n3\n1\n.\n4\n7\n.\n0\n5\n\n46 | Textual Cultures 3.1 (2008)scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models. I think I have to recognise that the project was ultimately not as effective at \u201cunveiling\u201d the author as I had hoped and was thus also not enough to endow Trevisa with those paternal qualities I was presumably looking for.But, what was worse, from the mid-seventies or so, and especially after the first two volumes came out in 1975, I began to have second thoughts about the then-dominant editorial principles which we had unconsciously assumed were appropriate to the editing of Trevisa, and began to write a se-ries of essays not setting up an idealised author and an idealised text, but distancing myself both from these essentially Formalist/New Critical princi-ples and at the same time questioning the unexamined hegemony of any ed-itorial/authorial/philosophical protocols that could be employed on any text. This distancing (and embarrassment) has continued down to the pres-ent, for in an article recently published in the Italian textual journal Ecdot-ica, I return again to the scene of the crime and use the personal and cultural distancing as a means of showing just what was then, and what might be now: that the earlier search for an immanent author (mis)represented by the extant, but inevitably corrupt, witnesses, has given way to a recognition that the variance shown in these witnesses is valuable evidence for the so-cialization of the text (Greetham 2006). In this case, my Ecdotica piece, while formally a response to Paul Eggert\u2019s generous and comprehensive re-view-essay (2005) of my Theories of the Text for the same journal, became not just a survey of the changing terrain of textual practice, but a demon-stration of how practice could be affected by theory. And, just as Freud bravely used his own dreams and his own \u201cFreudian slips\u201d (avant la lettre) in his account of the general phenomena, I was still smarting enough from my earlier unthinking acceptance of the then-dominant ideology to use my own \u201cslips\u201d as examples of what the shift in textual perspective might show.5 This section of the Ecdotica essay demonstrates how a witness that we re-garded as \u201cinsincere\u201d and \u201cinauthentic\u201d in the 1970s (and thus not fixable with any security on any conventional patrilinear stemma, and therefore not \u201cauthentic\u201d or \u201csincere\u201d enough to be cited as evidence of an authorial reading) would under the different textual dispensation of a quarter century later now become by far the most challenging and significant, precisely be-cause it showed a copyist/reader actively intervening in the construction of an early \u201csocialised\u201d text. If I were to edit Trevisa now, far from being re- 5.

It all depends where you\u2019re standing.Thus, by the time I came to my second potential father figure, Thomas Hoccleve, I was ready for a more than usually interrogative view of text and author, and this despite the fact that various features in Hoccleve\u2019s life (which, unlike Trevisa, were very well documented not only in contempo-rary records but in the introspective and self-revelatory nature of his own poetry) corresponded to some parts of my own personal narrative (bouts with depression, anxieties about professional status and productivity, and even the ability to write).For example, in the so-called highly autobiographical Series poems (Fur-nIvall and Gollancz [1892] 1970), Hoccleve introduces an interlocutor (\u201cFriend\u201d), who functions much like, say, Dr. Arbuthnot in Pope\u2019s Epistle to the said gentleman: to provoke, to question, to advise:Of studie was engendred thy seeknesse,And \u00feat was hard / woldest [thow] now agayn Entre into \u00feat laborious bisynesse,     Syn it thy mynde and eek thy wit had slayn?  Thy conceit is nat worth payndemayn: Let be / let be / bisye thee so no more Lest thee repente and reewe it ouersore.   (Dialogue, vv. 379\u201385)According to this \u201cFriend\u201d, Hoccleve suffered from an excess of \u201cStudie\u201d and \u201cThought\u201d (like Hamlet\u2019s \u201cthinking too precisely on th\u2019 event\u201d), which made him unable to write\u2014and this is, of course, what he writes about, the inability to write.6 It\u2019s an ironic game of productive non-production that ex-tends through Burton\u2019s Anatomy and beyond. He even had a Lacanian \u201cmir-ror\u201d stage, where he questions his own powers of perception, especially of the state of his own mental illness,7 a technique that Philip Roth was later to use in The Breast (though I would not therefore assert that Roth is a de-voted Hocclevean [see Greetham 1989b): 6. Hoccleve\u2019s line, that the \u201cthoght is wasting seed\u201d, appears in the \u201cPrologue\u201d to the Regiment of Princes; see FurnIvall 1897, 201\u20133. 7. For Hoccleve\u2019s \u201cmirror scene\u201d, see his \u201cComplaint\u201d in FurnIvall and Gollancz [1892] 1970, 162\u201375.\f:\n\n)\nT\nM\nG\n1\n4\n7\n1\n9\n1\n-\n3\n0\n-\n5\n2\n0\n2\n(\n\nE\nS\nU\nM\n\nj\n\nt\nc\ne\no\nr\nP\n\n.\n\n6\n2\n2\n3\n1\n.\n4\n7\n.\n0\n5\n\n48 | Textual Cultures 3.1 (2008)Many a sawte made I to this myrrowre,thinkynge, \u201cyf that I loke in this manereamonge folke / as I now do, none errowrof suspecte loke / may in my face appere,this countinance, I am svre, and this chere,If I forthe vse / is no thinge reprevableTo them that have / conseytes resonableAnd there-with-all I thowgt[e] thus anon:\u201cmen in theyr owne case / bene blynd alday,as I haue hard say / many a day agon,and in that [same] plight / I stonde may;how shall I doo / which is the best[e] waymy trowbled spirit for to bringe at rest[e]?yf I wist howe / fyne wolde I do the best[e]\u201d.  (Complaint, vv. 162\u201375)So Thomas Hoccleve was an attractive figure, one to whom I might in-deed establish a \u201cpsychic connection\u201d, particularly since we both seemed to have \u201cpsychic disjunctions\u201d. And so, perhaps as a replication of my technical \u201cmodelling\u201d for Trevisa as translator, I tried (I really did) to get further back, and closer to, my new author\u2019s actual idiolect than had previously been thought possible for any Middle English author. Surveying the anomalous condition of the Hoccleve oeuvre as it was (or was not) preserved in auto-graph manuscripts (Hoccleve was, after all, a professional scribe), I intro-duced what was at the time a radical editorial procedure: importing the well preserved accidentals of Hoccleve\u2019s own autograph manuscripts of other works into the substantive text of his most famous work, the De Regimine Principum (Regiment of Princes) or DRP, for which no autograph survived.8 Given that Hoccleve was an anally retentive bureaucrat and tried to im-pose order on the shifting surface features of late medieval verse, the edito-rial team, whose personnel varied over the years, found that there was even more consistency in usage in other surviving autographs than we might have hoped for, and that this radical editorial procedure actually worked: a similar modus operandi was later used for one of the texts in the California Twain, where no autographs remained, but accidentals usage could be estab- 8. I began work on this \u201cimporting\u201d of accidentals as a general editor of a new \u201cnor-malised\u201d edition. This editing was eventually completed by Charles R. Blyth (1999). For a description of this editorial procedure, see Greetham 1985 and 1987.\n\n\fDavid Greetham: Uncoupled | 49lished from collateral works.9 But what was doubtless (in retrospect) more significant for me at that second stage of an academic career, was that this attempted penetration into the compositional idiosyncrasies of an other-wise absent author gave me the opportunity to indulge in a new series of ar-cane models, using a computer-generated concordance (we were still on a mainframe in those days) and a reverse concordance. (See Figure 1 and Fig-ure 2). With such evidence analysed we were determined to map out our journey into the author\u2019s mind. This \u201cmapping\u201d was to follow a very prede-termined narrative of editorial choices, as is shown in the \u201cflowchart\u201d in Figure 3. This flowchart began to show some resemblance to the Hampton  9. hIrSt 1993. There is now a \u201crevised\u201d paperback edition (2002) of Roughing It pur-porting to be the \u201cfirst and only text that adheres to the author\u2019s wishes in details of wording, spelling, and punctuation, restored from original sources\u201d, but this is then noted as \u201creproduces the text and notes of the Mark Twain Project\u2019s 1993 edition\u201d.Figure 1 and 2 (below): Example of a reverse concordance for Hoccleve\u2019s De Regimine Principum. A reverse concordance simply lists all words in a lexical data base, but with the spellings in reverse order, so that, as in the examples of Figure 1 and Figure 2, we can see Hoccleve\u2019s use of words with an \u2013is ending and a \u2013ys (two alternative forms for, say, plurals or genitives) and thus hope to discover any authorial preference of consistency during a period when such spellings were not yet fixed. The computer file from which the reverse concordance was drawn was created by the computer services department at Adelphi University under the supervision of Peter Farley.\f:\n\n)\nT\nM\nG\n1\n4\n7\n1\n9\n1\n-\n3\n0\n-\n5\n2\n0\n2\n(\n\nE\nS\nU\nM\n\nj\n\nt\nc\ne\no\nr\nP\n\n.\n\n6\n2\n2\n3\n1\n.\n4\n7\n.\n0\n5\n\n50 | Textual Cultures 3.1 (2008)Court Maze, but (as with the translation \u201cmodels\u201d for Trevisa) was intended to give an editor a theoretical and practical guide to the recovery of autho-rial usage, inferred or otherwise. And, as with the examples of modelling from Trevisa, I don\u2019t now think there would be any great value in trying to explicate these processes, but simply to display them as evidence of textual hubris (and probably pretension as well). But again, stalwart Fredson Bowers happily took this display into the bosom of Studies in Bibliography.10 But having done what at first seemed editorially improper (even after hav-ing received the imprimatur of Fredson Bowers, and through him, by spiritual osmosis, that of W. W. Greg), there remained the nagging question: why was it possible for us to think of this apparently radical approach at one cultural moment and yet not to have questioned the inherited New Critical dogma that lay behind the editing of Trevisa (and, as Lee Patterson [1985] has pointed out, behind the virtually contemporaneous \u201cmodernist\u201d editing of the B Text of Piers Plowman by Kane and Donaldson)? What cultural/intellectual/proce-dural forces (usually unacknowledged, in fact usually invisible), tended to make us more susceptible to one editorial series of donn\u00e9es than another? Was this a case of Althusser\u2019s famous definition of \u201cideology\u201d as something inter-nalised and unseen, whereby a cultural moment established its identity? Or was it an example of Terry Eagleton\u2019s insistence that \u201cideology, like halitosis, is what the other person has\u201d?11 And if this were so, what would that do to the possibility of attaching ourselves psychically to any author, no matter how se- 10.

Did I really want to establish psychic confraternities with the faceless and/or the neurotic and depressed? Or with their opposites, whoever they might be? On a practical level, how much real progress could there be in moving from the monumental DPR (Trevisa), consuming ten years, to the equally monumental DRP (Hocc-leve), another ten? One consonant? And how strong could my own assertions of editorial self-confidence be in embracing either the faceless translator or the depressive poet, a poet who is most often illustrated by that manuscript of the Regiment bearing a portrait of his \u201cmaster\u201d, Chaucer, admonishing him from the margins? And what had it already said about the canonical (and per-sonal) status of Hoccleve, that the previous edition of the Regiment, by Fred Furnivall (1897), had overtly (and to my mind embarrassingly) selected the copy-text for that edition on the manuscript bearing the \u201cbest portrait of Chaucer\u201d, (i.e., of another poet, not the one you\u2019re editing!), even though the linguistic features of this selected copy-text were distinctly inappropriate, with traces of northern forms that would have been unlikely to come from the mouths or pens of either Hoccleve or Chaucer, both Londoners. Hoccleve was also \u201cOccleve\u201d, like a good Cockney.

By this time, I had critically distanced myself from the Formal-ist theory and practice of one edition (Trevisa); and while I was attracted to the psychological self-exposure of another author (Hoccleve), he was in any case gradually beginning to come into his own (as a couple of my \u201ccritical\u201d es-says argued), and I did not wish to hoist my colours to someone who was none-theless still a \u201cminor\u201d author. In the same period of my academic life, I had also come to the realization that there were unseen theoretical precepts driving the apparently \u201cneutral\u201d interventions of editors of the Greg-Bowers-Tanselle dis-pensation, and that these \u201cunseen\u201d precepts could undermine any claim that an editor (or critic) was simply \u201cdoing what comes naturally\u201d. Thus I began to understand that this lofty, while at the same time self-denigrating, principle was untenable historically and procedurally: Donaldon\u2019s acerbic and dismissive prescription (1970) for an \u201ceditorial death-wish\u201d was ironically both hubristic and unattainable. There was only one alternative: to cast myself off from a spe-cific author, or even group of authors (while at the same time maintaining a deep interest and commitment to \u201cauthoriality\u201d), and to begin to explore and make \u201cmanifest\u201d what had previously remained hidden. A scholarly-critical life not without authors, but, if anything, with too many of them. In this different trajectory, I was immensely helped (and inspired) by the work of others: I have already expressed my debt (in, for example, the writ-ing of Textual Transgressions) to the \u201cpersonalist criticism\u201d of my colleague Nancy K. Miller.12 W. Speed Hill provided a constant and reliable sounding-board (and voice of quiet reasonability) for some of my off-the-wall conjec-tures. And the ever-accommodating Fredson Bowers took one of my earlier forays into \u201cediting without an author\u201d into the pages of Studies in Bibliogra-phy, claiming, with a typical Bowersian irony, that a) he didn\u2019t understand a word of it and b) that the following detailed revisions, showing a full aware-ness of the supposedly incomprehensible, would improve the piece: and, of course, he was right.13 And through it all was the looming presence of Je-rome J. McGann and the \u201csocial\u201d theory of textuality, providing further evi-dence that the time was ripe for the sort of \u201cuncoupling\u201d I was embarking upon, even though Jerry had deftly managed to combine his social theory with a new commitment to D. G. Rossetti after an equally enthusiastic com-mitment to Byron, the editing of which he now disavowed. But Jerry is Jerry, and can juggle more balls than the rest of us.14 So the subterranean streams were in part navigated in my Theories of the  12. See reIman 1993 and mIller 1991. 13.

Do I envy my fellow-textuists who have found and remained loyal to their authors? Yes, I do recognise that having (almost) found but then lost my author(s) I have shown less stamina and determination and consistency than Speed Hill as Hooker, Don Reiman as Shelley, and Jack Stillinger as Keats (even with his occasional forays into Coleridge). It may be that some would regard my \u201cuncoupling\u201d as a form of dilettantism, an inability to hold fast to one individual, one oeuvre, one authorial presence. I have no persuasive argument to this charge, beyond the fact that at two earlier stages of my career I did at least try to approach and to reconstruct this idealised author, but then backed off. As Speed has re-minded me, even in my partly autobiographical Textual Transgressions (1998) my own biological father is distinctly absent (after all, he was dead by the time I was four months old), and one might then have imagined that my awareness of this familial gap would have made the search for a literary father figure the more psychologically pressing. After many years of therapy, I have yet to es-tablish whether the real-life loss in some way foredoomed the search for a re-placement, but since I have also embraced the marginal status of the alien (and thus feel more drawn to a figure like Auerbach or Kristeller than to com-fortable Trevisa and loony Hoccleve), this marginalisation has had its positive aspects: by looking in from the outside, I believe that this helped me to imag-ine a society in which everyone was to some extent an alien, everyone was made to feel a little less secure about his or her textual principles: in other words, STS and our twenty-eight years of meetings and publications. I\u2019m not convinced that this would have happened if I had not been uncoupled, if I had remained an acolyte of Trevisa or Hoccleve (or of Middle English, for that matter). So, non, je ne regrette rien.Given this retreat from the singularity of both text and author, the con-scious \u201cuncoupling\u201d of my title, is it any wonder that my next book should be a celebration of yet another unholy: its tentative title is The Pleasures of Contamination, with an hommage to Barthes, Cerquiglini, and to the tex-tual jouissance I have always found in the wonderfully \u201ccontaminated\u201d at-mosphere of these STS gatherings.15 City University of New York, Graduate Center 15.

Short answer  \\nThere is no sentence that contains the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d in the pages provided. (There is, however, a sentence on pages 45\u201346 that contains \u201cveil of print.\u201d)\\n\\n2. Extremely detailed answer  \\nAfter carefully reviewing pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d (2008) as provided from Project MUSE, no sentence includes the exact phrase \u201ccloak of print.\u201d What does appear in the text is a sentence with the phrase \u201cveil of print.\u201d That sentence reads as follows (with a slight uncertainty about typographical breaks stemming from pagination):  \\n\\n\u2003\u2003\u201c\u2026scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\u201d  \\n\\nIt appears that the query you posed may be referring to \u201ccloak of print\u201d when the text actually uses \u201cveil of print.\u201d If your intention was indeed to extract a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print,\u201d then unfortunately such a sentence is not found in the provided document. If, however, you meant the sentence with \u201cveil of print,\u201d then the full sentence extends from where \u201cveil of print\u201d appears through the following clause. (Be aware that the sentence might be split over the page break, so in the published version it likely appears as one continuous sentence.)  \\n\\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \\nThe file you provided is an excerpt from David Greetham\u2019s scholarly article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d published in Textual Cultures in Spring 2008 on Project MUSE. The article discusses Greetham\u2019s experiences and evolving approaches in textual criticism and the notion of authorial presence versus absence in editing practices. Your question specifically requested extraction of a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print\u201d from pages 45\u201346. However, after close examination the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d does not occur\u2014instead, the article uses \u201cveil of print\u201d in a sentence that contrasts the surface appearance of text (the \u201cveil of print\u201d) with the underlying \u201cscribal confusion and mis-transmission.\u201d As such, if you intended to refer to that sentence, the answer provided above is what appears in the document; otherwise, there is no sentence matching \u201ccloak of print.\u201d\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Earlier we've built a list of facts.\\nBut since in your previous steps you may have learned useful new facts or invalidated some false ones.\\nPlease update your list of facts based on the previous history, and provide these headings:\\n### 1.

Short answer  \nThere is no sentence that contains the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d in the pages provided. (There is, however, a sentence on pages 45\u201346 that contains \u201cveil of print.\u201d)\n\n2. Extremely detailed answer  \nAfter carefully reviewing pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d (2008) as provided from Project MUSE, no sentence includes the exact phrase \u201ccloak of print.\u201d What does appear in the text is a sentence with the phrase \u201cveil of print.\u201d That sentence reads as follows (with a slight uncertainty about typographical breaks stemming from pagination):  \n\n\u2003\u2003\u201c\u2026scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\u201d  \n\nIt appears that the query you posed may be referring to \u201ccloak of print\u201d when the text actually uses \u201cveil of print.\u201d If your intention was indeed to extract a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print,\u201d then unfortunately such a sentence is not found in the provided document. If, however, you meant the sentence with \u201cveil of print,\u201d then the full sentence extends from where \u201cveil of print\u201d appears through the following clause. (Be aware that the sentence might be split over the page break, so in the published version it likely appears as one continuous sentence.)  \n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \nThe file you provided is an excerpt from David Greetham\u2019s scholarly article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d published in Textual Cultures in Spring 2008 on Project MUSE. The article discusses Greetham\u2019s experiences and evolving approaches in textual criticism and the notion of authorial presence versus absence in editing practices. Your question specifically requested extraction of a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print\u201d from pages 45\u201346. However, after close examination the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d does not occur\u2014instead, the article uses \u201cveil of print\u201d in a sentence that contrasts the surface appearance of text (the \u201cveil of print\u201d) with the underlying \u201cscribal confusion and mis-transmission.\u201d As such, if you intended to refer to that sentence, the answer provided above is what appears in the document; otherwise, there is no sentence matching \u201ccloak of print.\u201d",

Short answer  \\nThere is no sentence that contains the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d in the pages provided. (There is, however, a sentence on pages 45\u201346 that contains \u201cveil of print.\u201d)\\n\\n2. Extremely detailed answer  \\nAfter carefully reviewing pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d (2008) as provided from Project MUSE, no sentence includes the exact phrase \u201ccloak of print.\u201d What does appear in the text is a sentence with the phrase \u201cveil of print.\u201d That sentence reads as follows (with a slight uncertainty about typographical breaks stemming from pagination):  \\n\\n\u2003\u2003\u201c\u2026scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\u201d  \\n\\nIt appears that the query you posed may be referring to \u201ccloak of print\u201d when the text actually uses \u201cveil of print.\u201d If your intention was indeed to extract a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print,\u201d then unfortunately such a sentence is not found in the provided document. If, however, you meant the sentence with \u201cveil of print,\u201d then the full sentence extends from where \u201cveil of print\u201d appears through the following clause. (Be aware that the sentence might be split over the page break, so in the published version it likely appears as one continuous sentence.)  \\n\\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \\nThe file you provided is an excerpt from David Greetham\u2019s scholarly article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d published in Textual Cultures in Spring 2008 on Project MUSE. The article discusses Greetham\u2019s experiences and evolving approaches in textual criticism and the notion of authorial presence versus absence in editing practices. Your question specifically requested extraction of a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print\u201d from pages 45\u201346. However, after close examination the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d does not occur\u2014instead, the article uses \u201cveil of print\u201d in a sentence that contrasts the surface appearance of text (the \u201cveil of print\u201d) with the underlying \u201cscribal confusion and mis-transmission.\u201d As such, if you intended to refer to that sentence, the answer provided above is what appears in the document; otherwise, there is no sentence matching \u201ccloak of print.\u201d\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You're still working towards solving this task:\\n```\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease retrieve the exact sentence from pages 45-46 of David Greetham's article \\\"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\\\" (2008) on Project MUSE (DOI:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44) that includes the phrase 'cloak of print'.\\n---\\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\\n\\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\\n### 1.

Short answer  \nThere is no sentence that contains the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d in the pages provided. (There is, however, a sentence on pages 45\u201346 that contains \u201cveil of print.\u201d)\n\n2. Extremely detailed answer  \nAfter carefully reviewing pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d (2008) as provided from Project MUSE, no sentence includes the exact phrase \u201ccloak of print.\u201d What does appear in the text is a sentence with the phrase \u201cveil of print.\u201d That sentence reads as follows (with a slight uncertainty about typographical breaks stemming from pagination):  \n\n\u2003\u2003\u201c\u2026scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\u201d  \n\nIt appears that the query you posed may be referring to \u201ccloak of print\u201d when the text actually uses \u201cveil of print.\u201d If your intention was indeed to extract a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print,\u201d then unfortunately such a sentence is not found in the provided document. If, however, you meant the sentence with \u201cveil of print,\u201d then the full sentence extends from where \u201cveil of print\u201d appears through the following clause. (Be aware that the sentence might be split over the page break, so in the published version it likely appears as one continuous sentence.)  \n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \nThe file you provided is an excerpt from David Greetham\u2019s scholarly article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d published in Textual Cultures in Spring 2008 on Project MUSE. The article discusses Greetham\u2019s experiences and evolving approaches in textual criticism and the notion of authorial presence versus absence in editing practices. Your question specifically requested extraction of a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print\u201d from pages 45\u201346. However, after close examination the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d does not occur\u2014instead, the article uses \u201cveil of print\u201d in a sentence that contrasts the surface appearance of text (the \u201cveil of print\u201d) with the underlying \u201cscribal confusion and mis-transmission.\u201d As such, if you intended to refer to that sentence, the answer provided above is what appears in the document; otherwise, there is no sentence matching \u201ccloak of print.\u201d",

Short answer  \\nThere is no sentence that contains the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d in the pages provided. (There is, however, a sentence on pages 45\u201346 that contains \u201cveil of print.\u201d)\\n\\n2. Extremely detailed answer  \\nAfter carefully reviewing pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d (2008) as provided from Project MUSE, no sentence includes the exact phrase \u201ccloak of print.\u201d What does appear in the text is a sentence with the phrase \u201cveil of print.\u201d That sentence reads as follows (with a slight uncertainty about typographical breaks stemming from pagination):  \\n\\n\u2003\u2003\u201c\u2026scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\u201d  \\n\\nIt appears that the query you posed may be referring to \u201ccloak of print\u201d when the text actually uses \u201cveil of print.\u201d If your intention was indeed to extract a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print,\u201d then unfortunately such a sentence is not found in the provided document. If, however, you meant the sentence with \u201cveil of print,\u201d then the full sentence extends from where \u201cveil of print\u201d appears through the following clause. (Be aware that the sentence might be split over the page break, so in the published version it likely appears as one continuous sentence.)  \\n\\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \\nThe file you provided is an excerpt from David Greetham\u2019s scholarly article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d published in Textual Cultures in Spring 2008 on Project MUSE. The article discusses Greetham\u2019s experiences and evolving approaches in textual criticism and the notion of authorial presence versus absence in editing practices. Your question specifically requested extraction of a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print\u201d from pages 45\u201346. However, after close examination the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d does not occur\u2014instead, the article uses \u201cveil of print\u201d in a sentence that contrasts the surface appearance of text (the \u201cveil of print\u201d) with the underlying \u201cscribal confusion and mis-transmission.\u201d As such, if you intended to refer to that sentence, the answer provided above is what appears in the document; otherwise, there is no sentence matching \u201ccloak of print.\u201d\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[FACTS LIST]:\\nHere is the updated list of the facts that I know:\\n```\\nfinal_answer: \\n{\\n  \\\"1.

Extremely detailed answer  \nAfter carefully reviewing pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d (2008) as provided from Project MUSE, no sentence includes the exact phrase \u201ccloak of print.\u201d What does appear in the text is a sentence with the phrase \u201cveil of print.\u201d That sentence reads as follows (with a slight uncertainty about typographical breaks stemming from pagination):  \n\n\u2003\u2003\u201c\u2026scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\u201d  \n\nIt appears that the query you posed may be referring to \u201ccloak of print\u201d when the text actually uses \u201cveil of print.\u201d If your intention was indeed to extract a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print,\u201d then unfortunately such a sentence is not found in the provided document. If, however, you meant the sentence with \u201cveil of print,\u201d then the full sentence extends from where \u201cveil of print\u201d appears through the following clause. (Be aware that the sentence might be split over the page break, so in the published version it likely appears as one continuous sentence.)  \n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \nThe file you provided is an excerpt from David Greetham\u2019s scholarly article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d published in Textual Cultures in Spring 2008 on Project MUSE. The article discusses Greetham\u2019s experiences and evolving approaches in textual criticism and the notion of authorial presence versus absence in editing practices. Your question specifically requested extraction of a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print\u201d from pages 45\u201346. However, after close examination the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d does not occur\u2014instead, the article uses \u201cveil of print\u201d in a sentence that contrasts the surface appearance of text (the \u201cveil of print\u201d) with the underlying \u201cscribal confusion and mis-transmission.\u201d As such, if you intended to refer to that sentence, the answer provided above is what appears in the document; otherwise, there is no sentence matching \u201ccloak of print.\u201d",

Facts that we have learned\": \"\u2022 A Google search and review of available resources indicate that the article does not contain the exact phrase 'cloak of print'.\\n\u2022 Instead, on pages 45\u201346 a sentence contains the phrase 'veil of print' (not 'cloak of print').\\n\u2022 The extracted sentence (or its fragment) reads approximately as: '...scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.'\\n\u2022 This reveals a mismatch; the query refers to 'cloak of print' while the text uses 'veil of print'.\",\n  \"3. Facts still to look up\": \"\u2022 It remains to be verified whether any version or edition of the article contains the phrase 'cloak of print' instead of 'veil of print'.\\n\u2022 Further confirmation that the retrieved sentence (with 'veil of print') is complete and unaltered in the official publication might be needed by directly checking the source if discrepancies exist.\",\n  \"4. Facts still to derive\": \"\u2022 We need to derive that the answer to the original task is that no sentence containing 'cloak of print' exists in the designated pages; only a sentence with 'veil of print' does.\\n\u2022 From this, the final structured answer must explain the discrepancy between 'cloak of print' and 'veil of print', provide the extracted sentence as context, and note that if the manager intended 'cloak of print', it does not appear in the text.\"\n}\n```",

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nAfter retrieving and inspecting the PDF version of David Greetham\u2019s \\\"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\\\" (2008) via Project MUSE (DOI:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44), I specifically examined pages 45\u201346 for the requested phrase. The expected sentence containing \\\"cloak of print\\\" was not found. Instead, the text contains a sentence that features the phrase \\\"veil of print.\\\" The extracted sentence (noting that pagination may lead to slight breaks in the continuous sentence) is approximately as follows:\\n\\n\\\"...scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis\u2010transmission.

Additional context (if relevant):\\nThe article discusses complex ideas related to textual criticism and the inherent challenges of authorial interpretation, using metaphors such as the \\\"veil of print\\\" to describe the obscuring effect of scribal errors and mis-transmissions. It is possible that the phrase \\\"cloak of print\\\" was mistaken for or conflated with the actual metaphor. In conclusion, in the version of the article available on Project MUSE, no sentence contains \\\"cloak of print,\\\" and the relevant sentence correctly uses \\\"veil of print.\\\"\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'New task:\\\\nYou\\\\'re a helpful agent named \\\\'search_agent\\\\'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nPlease retrieve the exact sentence from pages 45-46 of David Greetham\\\\'s article \\\"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\\\" (2008) on Project MUSE (DOI:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44) that includes the phrase \\\\'cloak of print\\\\'.\\\\n---\\\\nYou\\\\'re helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\\\\n\\\\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\\\\n### 1.

Short answer  \\\\nThere is no sentence that contains the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d in the pages provided. (There is, however, a sentence on pages 45\u201346 that contains \u201cveil of print.\u201d)\\\\n\\\\n2. Extremely detailed answer  \\\\nAfter carefully reviewing pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d (2008) as provided from Project MUSE, no sentence includes the exact phrase \u201ccloak of print.\u201d What does appear in the text is a sentence with the phrase \u201cveil of print.\u201d That sentence reads as follows (with a slight uncertainty about typographical breaks stemming from pagination):  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2003\\\\u2003\u201c\u2026scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\u201d  \\\\n\\\\nIt appears that the query you posed may be referring to \u201ccloak of print\u201d when the text actually uses \u201cveil of print.\u201d If your intention was indeed to extract a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print,\u201d then unfortunately such a sentence is not found in the provided document. If, however, you meant the sentence with \u201cveil of print,\u201d then the full sentence extends from where \u201cveil of print\u201d appears through the following clause. (Be aware that the sentence might be split over the page break, so in the published version it likely appears as one continuous sentence.)  \\\\n\\\\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \\\\nThe file you provided is an excerpt from David Greetham\u2019s scholarly article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d published in Textual Cultures in Spring 2008 on Project MUSE. The article discusses Greetham\u2019s experiences and evolving approaches in textual criticism and the notion of authorial presence versus absence in editing practices. Your question specifically requested extraction of a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print\u201d from pages 45\u201346. However, after close examination the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d does not occur\u2014instead, the article uses \u201cveil of print\u201d in a sentence that contrasts the surface appearance of text (the \u201cveil of print\u201d) with the underlying \u201cscribal confusion and mis-transmission.\u201d As such, if you intended to refer to that sentence, the answer provided above is what appears in the document; otherwise, there is no sentence matching \u201ccloak of print.\u201d'}]\\n---\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': '[FACTS LIST]:\\\\nHere is the updated list of the facts that I know:\\\\n```\\\\nfinal_answer: \\\\n{\\\\n  \\\"1.

Facts that we have learned\\\": \\\"\u2022 A Google search and review of available resources indicate that the article does not contain the exact phrase \\\\'cloak of print\\\\'.\\\\\\\\n\u2022 Instead, on pages 45\u201346 a sentence contains the phrase \\\\'veil of print\\\\' (not \\\\'cloak of print\\\\').\\\\\\\\n\u2022 The extracted sentence (or its fragment) reads approximately as: \\\\'...scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission.

Facts still to derive\\\": \\\"\u2022 We need to derive that the answer to the original task is that no sentence containing \\\\'cloak of print\\\\' exists in the designated pages; only a sentence with \\\\'veil of print\\\\' does.\\\\\\\\n\u2022 From this, the final structured answer must explain the discrepancy between \\\\'cloak of print\\\\' and \\\\'veil of print\\\\', provide the extracted sentence as context, and note that if the manager intended \\\\'cloak of print\\\\', it does not appear in the text.\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n```'}]\\n---\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Calling tools:\\\\n[{\\\\'id\\\\': \\\\'call_PqaafQEjXBSDRzSPUSwWEs25\\\\', \\\\'type\\\\': \\\\'function\\\\', \\\\'function\\\\': {\\\\'name\\\\': \\\\'final_answer\\\\', \\\\'arguments\\\\': {\\\\'answer\\\\': \\\\'### 1. Task outcome (short version):\\\\\\\\nNo sentence on pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article contains the exact phrase \\\"cloak of print.\\\" Instead, the text includes a sentence with the phrase \\\"veil of print.\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\\\\\nAfter retrieving and inspecting the PDF version of David Greetham\u2019s \\\"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\\\" (2008) via Project MUSE (DOI:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44), I specifically examined pages 45\u201346 for the requested phrase. The expected sentence containing \\\"cloak of print\\\" was not found. Instead, the text contains a sentence that features the phrase \\\"veil of print.\\\" The extracted sentence (noting that pagination may lead to slight breaks in the continuous sentence) is approximately as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\"...scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis\u2010transmission.

Additional context (if relevant):\\\\\\\\nThe article discusses complex ideas related to textual criticism and the inherent challenges of authorial interpretation, using metaphors such as the \\\"veil of print\\\" to describe the obscuring effect of scribal errors and mis-transmissions. It is possible that the phrase \\\"cloak of print\\\" was mistaken for or conflated with the actual metaphor. In conclusion, in the version of the article available on Project MUSE, no sentence contains \\\"cloak of print,\\\" and the relevant sentence correctly uses \\\"veil of print.\\\"\\\\'}}}]'}]\\n---\\n</summary_of_work>\\nLast output from code snippet:\\nmis\u2011transmission\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\\nRead the above conversation and output a FINAL ANSWER to the question.

Task outcome (short version):\nNo sentence on pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article contains the exact phrase \"cloak of print.\" Instead, the text includes a sentence with the phrase \"veil of print.\"\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nAfter retrieving and inspecting the PDF version of David Greetham\u2019s \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\" (2008) via Project MUSE (DOI:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44), I specifically examined pages 45\u201346 for the requested phrase. The expected sentence containing \"cloak of print\" was not found. Instead, the text contains a sentence that features the phrase \"veil of print.\" The extracted sentence (noting that pagination may lead to slight breaks in the continuous sentence) is approximately as follows:\n\n\"...scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis\u2010transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\"\n\nThis indicates that there might be a discrepancy between the query and the actual text \u2013 the query mentions \"cloak of print\" while the text uses \"veil of print.\"\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe article discusses complex ideas related to textual criticism and the inherent challenges of authorial interpretation, using metaphors such as the \"veil of print\" to describe the obscuring effect of scribal errors and mis-transmissions. It is possible that the phrase \"cloak of print\" was mistaken for or conflated with the actual metaphor. In conclusion, in the version of the article available on Project MUSE, no sentence contains \"cloak of print,\" and the relevant sentence correctly uses \"veil of print.\"\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'New task:\\nYou\\'re a helpful agent named \\'search_agent\\'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease retrieve the exact sentence from pages 45-46 of David Greetham\\'s article \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\" (2008) on Project MUSE (DOI:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44) that includes the phrase \\'cloak of print\\'.\\n---\\nYou\\'re helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\\n\\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\\n### 1.

Short answer  \\nThere is no sentence that contains the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d in the pages provided. (There is, however, a sentence on pages 45\u201346 that contains \u201cveil of print.\u201d)\\n\\n2. Extremely detailed answer  \\nAfter carefully reviewing pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d (2008) as provided from Project MUSE, no sentence includes the exact phrase \u201ccloak of print.\u201d What does appear in the text is a sentence with the phrase \u201cveil of print.\u201d That sentence reads as follows (with a slight uncertainty about typographical breaks stemming from pagination):  \\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\u201c\u2026scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission. Our/my author lay beyond this confusion, immanent as the lodestar for my arcane models.\u201d  \\n\\nIt appears that the query you posed may be referring to \u201ccloak of print\u201d when the text actually uses \u201cveil of print.\u201d If your intention was indeed to extract a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print,\u201d then unfortunately such a sentence is not found in the provided document. If, however, you meant the sentence with \u201cveil of print,\u201d then the full sentence extends from where \u201cveil of print\u201d appears through the following clause. (Be aware that the sentence might be split over the page break, so in the published version it likely appears as one continuous sentence.)  \\n\\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \\nThe file you provided is an excerpt from David Greetham\u2019s scholarly article \u201cUncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\u201d published in Textual Cultures in Spring 2008 on Project MUSE. The article discusses Greetham\u2019s experiences and evolving approaches in textual criticism and the notion of authorial presence versus absence in editing practices. Your question specifically requested extraction of a sentence containing \u201ccloak of print\u201d from pages 45\u201346. However, after close examination the phrase \u201ccloak of print\u201d does not occur\u2014instead, the article uses \u201cveil of print\u201d in a sentence that contrasts the surface appearance of text (the \u201cveil of print\u201d) with the underlying \u201cscribal confusion and mis-transmission.\u201d As such, if you intended to refer to that sentence, the answer provided above is what appears in the document; otherwise, there is no sentence matching \u201ccloak of print.\u201d'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': '[FACTS LIST]:\\nHere is the updated list of the facts that I know:\\n```\\nfinal_answer: \\n{\\n  \"1.

Facts that we have learned\": \"\u2022 A Google search and review of available resources indicate that the article does not contain the exact phrase \\'cloak of print\\'.\\\\n\u2022 Instead, on pages 45\u201346 a sentence contains the phrase \\'veil of print\\' (not \\'cloak of print\\').\\\\n\u2022 The extracted sentence (or its fragment) reads approximately as: \\'...scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission.

Facts still to look up\": \"\u2022 It remains to be verified whether any version or edition of the article contains the phrase \\'cloak of print\\' instead of \\'veil of print\\'.\\\\n\u2022 Further confirmation that the retrieved sentence (with \\'veil of print\\') is complete and unaltered in the official publication might be needed by directly checking the source if discrepancies exist.\",\\n  \"4.

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nNo sentence on pages 45\u201346 of David Greetham\u2019s article contains the exact phrase \"cloak of print.\" Instead, the text includes a sentence with the phrase \"veil of print.\"\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nAfter retrieving and inspecting the PDF version of David Greetham\u2019s \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\" (2008) via Project MUSE (DOI:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44), I specifically examined pages 45\u201346 for the requested phrase. The expected sentence containing \"cloak of print\" was not found. Instead, the text contains a sentence that features the phrase \"veil of print.\" The extracted sentence (noting that pagination may lead to slight breaks in the continuous sentence) is approximately as follows:\\\\n\\\\n\"...scured not by a \u201cveil of print\u201d but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis\u2010transmission.

Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nThe article discusses complex ideas related to textual criticism and the inherent challenges of authorial interpretation, using metaphors such as the \"veil of print\" to describe the obscuring effect of scribal errors and mis-transmissions. It is possible that the phrase \"cloak of print\" was mistaken for or conflated with the actual metaphor. In conclusion, in the version of the article available on Project MUSE, no sentence contains \"cloak of print,\" and the relevant sentence correctly uses \"veil of print.\"\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>\nLast output from code snippet:\nmis\u2011transmission",
