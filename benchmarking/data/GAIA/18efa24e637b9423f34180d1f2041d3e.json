Facts to derive\n\u2022 The definitive title and version of the \u201clatest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article\u201d based on the available data  \n\u2003\u2013 Derive, by checking revision dates or creation dates, which article qualifies as the \u201clatest\u201d from 2022 about Lego.  \n\u2022 The number of images contained in that article  \n\u2003\u2013 Once the correct article is identified, derive the number by parsing the article\u2019s content and counting all embedded images (using tools like the Wikipedia API or HTML parsing methods).  \n\u2022 Clear reasoning on which images are counted  \n\u2003\u2013 Derive a set of criteria for inclusion (e.g., main images, infobox pictures, gallery images) to ensure the same standard is applied uniformly during counting.\n```\n\nNow begin!

For instance, is it the article about Lego that was last updated in 2022, or is it an article newly created in 2022 with \u201cLego\u201d in the title?  \n\u2003\u2013 This may involve consulting Wikipedia\u2019s revision history or category listings (e.g., using the English Wikipedia or its API).  \n\u2022 The content of that article as it exists on English Wikipedia  \n\u2003\u2013 Specifically, the article page (via en.wikipedia.org or the API) from which the image count will be determined.  \n\u2022 Guidance on counting images  \n\u2003\u2013 Determine what counts as an \u201cimage\u201d (e.g., pictures embedded in the article body, illustrations, or other media files).  \n\u2022 Source information  \n\u2003\u2013 Use the English Wikipedia website (https://en.wikipedia.org) or its API and revision history pages, along with any linked documentation on counting or listing media files in an article.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The definitive title and version of the \u201clatest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article\u201d based on the available data  \n\u2003\u2013 Derive, by checking revision dates or creation dates, which article qualifies as the \u201clatest\u201d from 2022 about Lego.  \n\u2022 The number of images contained in that article  \n\u2003\u2013 Once the correct article is identified, derive the number by parsing the article\u2019s content and counting all embedded images (using tools like the Wikipedia API or HTML parsing methods).  \n\u2022 Clear reasoning on which images are counted  \n\u2003\u2013 Derive a set of criteria for inclusion (e.g., main images, infobox pictures, gallery images) to ensure the same standard is applied uniformly during counting.\n```",

Once the correct article is determined, retrieve its content (such as by obtaining its HTML page or using the Wikipedia API) to access all embedded images.\n3. Parse the article content to locate all images (for example, by counting all <img> tags and checking any galleries or infobox images) following consistent criteria for inclusion.\n4. Cross-check the count using a verification step with available data (for instance, comparing with the article's media list or revision history information) to ensure the final count is correct.\n5. Provide the final verified count of images as the final answer using the final_answer tool.\n\n\n```",

Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['time', 'random', 'pandas', 'queue', 're', 'json', 'statistics', 'os', 'numpy', 'collections', 'PIL', 'unicodedata', 'pubchempy', 'pptx', 'csv', 'fractions', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 'torch', 'datetime', 'PyPDF2', 'sympy', 'bs4', 'xml', 'pydub', 'itertools', 'requests', 'Bio', 'io', 'scipy', 'zipfile', 'stat', 'math', 'sklearn']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['time', 'random', 'pandas', 'queue', 're', 'json', 'statistics', 'os', 'numpy', 'collections', 'PIL', 'unicodedata', 'pubchempy', 'pptx', 'csv', 'fractions', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 'torch', 'datetime', 'PyPDF2', 'sympy', 'bs4', 'xml', 'pydub', 'itertools', 'requests', 'Bio', 'io', 'scipy', 'zipfile', 'stat', 'math', 'sklearn']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded.\nRun verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer!\nHere is the task:\nHow many images are there in the latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article?\n\nTo output the final answer, use the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]\nYour FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your FINAL ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and DO NOT INCLUDE UNITS such as $ or USD or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, output 'FINAL ANSWER: Unable to determine'\n",
