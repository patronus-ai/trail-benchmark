This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files.

If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['bs4', 'scipy', 'math', 'pubchempy', 'os', 'yahoo_finance', 'xml', 'sympy', 'pandas', 'statistics', 're', 'requests', 'time', 'PIL', 'itertools', 'random', 'torch', 'stat', 'pptx', 'pydub', 'csv', 'collections', 'sklearn', 'numpy', 'fractions', 'io', 'json', 'Bio', 'datetime', 'unicodedata', 'zipfile', 'PyPDF2', 'chess', 'queue']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['bs4', 'scipy', 'math', 'pubchempy', 'os', 'yahoo_finance', 'xml', 'sympy', 'pandas', 'statistics', 're', 'requests', 'time', 'PIL', 'itertools', 'random', 'torch', 'stat', 'pptx', 'pydub', 'csv', 'collections', 'sklearn', 'numpy', 'fractions', 'io', 'json', 'Bio', 'datetime', 'unicodedata', 'zipfile', 'PyPDF2', 'chess', 'queue']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The secret message is \"Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.\"  \n\u2003\u2013 It is encrypted using a Caesar cipher.  \n\u2022 The decrypted message indicates where to meet for a Friday picnic.  \n\u2022 The task stresses that a correct answer must be found and verified using any available tools or steps.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Information on Caesar cipher decryption methods (e.g., shifting letters) \u2013 this could be found on websites like Wikipedia or a dedicated cryptography tool such as dcode.fr.  \n\u2022 (If necessary) Details on any potential ambiguities in the Caesar cipher procedure or known common shift values \u2013 reference sources include cryptography tutorials or documentation.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The correct shift value used in the Caesar cipher.  \n\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: By testing likely short words in the message (e.g., \u201csx\u201d), we can hypothesize that it corresponds to an English two\u2010letter word such as \u201cin\u201d or \u201cis\u201d.  \n\u2003\u2013 Calculation: Assuming \u201csx\u201d \u2192 \u201cin\u201d implies a shift of 10 letters backward (s: 18 \u2192 8 yields \u201ci\u201d; x: 23 \u2192 13 yields \u201cn\u201d).  \n\u2022 Decrypt each word with a shift of 10:\n\u2003\u2013 \"Zsmxsm\":  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Z (25) \u2212 10 = 15 \u2192 P  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 s (18) \u2212 10 = 8\u2003 \u2192 I  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 m (12) \u2212 10 = 2\u2003 \u2192 C  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 x (23) \u2212 10 = 13 \u2192 N  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 s (18) \u2212 10 = 8\u2003 \u2192 I  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 m (12) \u2212 10 = 2\u2003 \u2192 C  \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Decrypted as \"picnic\".  \n\u2003\u2013 \"sc\":  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 s (18) \u2212 10 = 8\u2003 \u2192 I  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 c (2) \u2212 10 = -8 mod26 = 18 \u2192 S  \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Decrypted as \"is\".  \n\u2003\u2013 \"sx\":  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 s (18) \u2212 10 = 8\u2003 \u2192 I  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 x (23) \u2212 10 = 13 \u2192 N  \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Decrypted as \"in\".  \n\u2003\u2013 \"Zyvilsec\":  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Z (25) \u2212 10 = 15 \u2192 P  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 y (24) \u2212 10 = 14 \u2192 O  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 v (21) \u2212 10 = 11 \u2192 L  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 i (8) \u2212 10 = -2 mod26 = 24 \u2192 Y  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 l (11) \u2212 10 = 1\u2003 \u2192 B  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 s (18) \u2212 10 = 8\u2003 \u2192 I  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 e (4) \u2212 10 = -6 mod26 = 20 \u2192 U  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 c (2) \u2212 10 = -8 mod26 = 18 \u2192 S  \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Decrypted as \"polybius\".  \n\u2003\u2013 \"Zvkjk\":  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Z (25) \u2212 10 = 15 \u2192 P  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 v (21) \u2212 10 = 11 \u2192 L  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 k (10) \u2212 10 = 0\u2003 \u2192 A  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 j (9) \u2212 10 = -1 mod26 = 25 \u2192 Z  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 k (10) \u2212 10 = 0\u2003 \u2192 A  \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Decrypted as \"plaza\".  \n\u2022 Combined, the full decrypted message is: \"picnic is in polybius plaza\".\n```",
