Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day during the first week of August 2015 features an image showing the lights of a city on the horizon.  \n\u2022 This city\u2019s namesake (i.e. the person after whom the city is named) is also the namesake of a landmark building in Chicago.  \n\u2022 The task asks for the name of the architectural firm that designed that Chicago landmark building, and in particular, for the first name that appears in the firm\u2019s name as of June 2023.  \n\u2022 It is stated that a correct answer exists and that relevant research tools are available to find it.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The specific NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day in the first week of August 2015 that shows a city\u2019s lights, in order to identify the city (and from its name, deduce the namesake).  \n\u2003 \u2013 Sources: NASA\u2019s APOD archive (apod.nasa.gov) and possibly any accompanying explanatory notes or links provided on that day\u2019s entry.  \n\u2022 Confirm the identity of the landmark Chicago building that is named after the person who is the namesake of the city.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Sources: Historical records or encyclopedic entries (for example, Wikipedia or official Chicago landmarks databases) that describe the building\u2019s name and naming history.  \n\u2022 Identify the architectural firm that designed that landmark building and verify the firm\u2019s official name as of June 2023.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Sources: Architectural histories, the building\u2019s official website or documentation, and company or industry publications that refer to the firm (e.g., the firm\u2019s website, architecture databases, or reliable publications).\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 From the APOD entry and the identification of the city, deduce the namesake\u2019s identity (i.e. the individual after whom the city was named) which is also used in the name of the Chicago landmark building.  \n\u2022 Determine which Chicago building is being referenced based on its namesake.  \n\u2022 From the historical and architectural research, derive the architectural firm responsible for designing the identified Chicago landmark building.  \n\u2022 Finally, from the full name of that architectural firm, extract the first name appearing in the firm\u2019s name as of June 2023 (for example, if the firm is \u201cSkidmore, Owings & Merrill\u201d, then \u201cSkidmore\u201d would be that first name).\n```\n\nNow begin!

IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
