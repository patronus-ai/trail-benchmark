Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task states that \u201cthe longest\u2010lived vertebrate is named after an island.\u201d  \n\u2003Reasoning: This explicitly tells us that the species in question derives its name from an island.  \n\u2022 The task asks: \u201cAccording to Wikipedia as of January 1, 2021, what is the 2020 estimated population of that island, to the nearest thousand?\u201d  \n\u2003Reasoning: This tells us that we must refer to the Wikipedia information as it was on that date concerning an island\u2019s population estimate for the year 2020, and then round the figure to the nearest thousand.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The identity of the \u201clongest\u2010lived vertebrate\u201d that is named after an island.  \n\u2003Reasoning: We must verify which species this refers to. (Background knowledge suggests the Greenland shark, named after Greenland, which is the world\u2019s largest island. However, this fact should be confirmed, for example, by checking authoritative sources or Wikipedia.)\n\u2022 The Wikipedia page for the island in question (presumably Greenland) as of or with data updated near January 1, 2021.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The task requires the 2020 estimated population number from Wikipedia. We need to ensure that the population figure we retrieve corresponds to the version of the article from that date.  \n\u2003Where to look: The Wikipedia article \u201cGreenland\u201d (or the relevant revision dated January 1, 2021) and/or associated official statistics referenced in that article.\n\u2022 The exact 2020 estimated population number for Greenland given in that Wikipedia revision.  \n\u2003Reasoning: We need a precise number that we can then round to the nearest thousand.  \n\u2003Where to look: The \u201cPopulation\u201d section (infobox or text) of the Greenland Wikipedia page and its cited sources (for instance, Statistics Greenland or similar).\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive that the island referred to is Greenland by linking the species name (the \u201cGreenland shark\u201d) to the island.  \n\u2003Reasoning: By confirming that the longest\u2010lived vertebrate (the Greenland shark) is indeed named after Greenland, we establish that the island in question is Greenland.\n\u2022 Derive the final answer by taking the raw 2020 population number from Wikipedia and rounding it to the nearest thousand.  \n\u2003Reasoning: Once the precise population figure is obtained, simple numerical rounding is needed to convert it to \u201cto the nearest thousand.\u201d\n\u2022 If necessary, cross-check the population figure by comparing sources or running any numerical verification steps to ensure accuracy.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The task emphasizes accuracy and verification; hence, logical computation and validation of the number is required before the final answer is provided.\n```\n\nNow begin!

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The identity of the \u201clongest\u2010lived vertebrate\u201d that is named after an island.  \\n\u2003Reasoning: We must verify which species this refers to.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
