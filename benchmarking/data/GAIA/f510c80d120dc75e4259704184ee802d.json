Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['scipy', 'bs4', 'pydub', 'PIL', 'stat', 'statistics', 'json', 'torch', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 'PyPDF2', 'datetime', 'collections', 'unicodedata', 'sklearn', 'queue', 'requests', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'numpy', 'io', 'random', 'math', 'itertools', 'sympy', 'Bio', 'zipfile', 'time', 'csv', 'pptx', 're', 'os', 'pandas', 'xml']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 Standard logical equivalences and laws, such as:\\n\u2003\u2013 De Morgan's Laws: (lookup in any standard logic textbook or reliable online source such as \u201cWikipedia: De Morgan's laws\u201d)\\n\u2003\u2013 Material Implication: (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acA \u2228 B); (lookup in sources on propositional logic)\\n\u2003\u2013 Contrapositive: (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA); (standard fact available in logic materials)\\n\u2003\u2013 Negation of Implication: \u00ac(A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (A \u2227 \u00acB); (verify in propositional logic texts)\\n\u2022 Reference information on the transformation of conditionals with a negated antecedent, to assess whether (\u00acA \u2192 B) is indeed equivalent to (A \u2228 \u00acB). (Could check sites like Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy or classical logic resources).\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive and verify each equivalence:  \\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that \u00ac(A \u2227 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 \u00acB) and \u00ac(A \u2228 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) hold by De Morgan's laws.  \\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that (A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA) holds by the contrapositive equivalence.  \\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that (A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 B) is equivalent by material implication.  \\n\u2003\u2013 Re-derive (\u00acA \u2192 B) using the transformation for implications: normally, X \u2192 Y is logically equivalent to (\u00acX \u2228 Y). Replacing X with \u00acA gives (\u00ac(\u00acA) \u2228 B), which simplifies to (A \u2228 B); then compare this with (A \u2228 \u00acB).  \\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that \u00ac(A \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2227 \u00acB) is correct using the negation of the material implication.\\n\\n\u2022 Conclude that the equivalence (\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB) is not valid when carried out \u2013 because by material implication its left side should be equivalent to (A \u2228 B), not (A \u2228 \u00acB). This logical derivation shows that it is not equivalent to the others.\\n\\n\u2022 Therefore, the specific statement that does not fit with the valid logical equivalences is:  \\n\u2003\u2003(\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB)\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['scipy', 'bs4', 'pydub', 'PIL', 'stat', 'statistics', 'json', 'torch', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 'PyPDF2', 'datetime', 'collections', 'unicodedata', 'sklearn', 'queue', 'requests', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'numpy', 'io', 'random', 'math', 'itertools', 'sympy', 'Bio', 'zipfile', 'time', 'csv', 'pptx', 're', 'os', 'pandas', 'xml']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task lists six logical equivalences:  \n\u2003\u2013 \u00ac(A \u2227 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 \u00acB)  \n\u2003\u2013 \u00ac(A \u2228 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB)  \n\u2003\u2013 (A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA)  \n\u2003\u2013 (A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 B)  \n\u2003\u2013 (\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB)  \n\u2003\u2013 \u00ac(A \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2227 \u00acB)\n\n\u2022 It is stated that there exists one equivalence from the list that is not logically equivalent to the rest.\n\n\u2022 The task instructs that only one correct answer exists and emphasizes the importance of certainty and verification.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Standard logical equivalences and laws, such as:\n\u2003\u2013 De Morgan's Laws: (lookup in any standard logic textbook or reliable online source such as \u201cWikipedia: De Morgan's laws\u201d)\n\u2003\u2013 Material Implication: (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acA \u2228 B); (lookup in sources on propositional logic)\n\u2003\u2013 Contrapositive: (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA); (standard fact available in logic materials)\n\u2003\u2013 Negation of Implication: \u00ac(A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (A \u2227 \u00acB); (verify in propositional logic texts)\n\u2022 Reference information on the transformation of conditionals with a negated antecedent, to assess whether (\u00acA \u2192 B) is indeed equivalent to (A \u2228 \u00acB). (Could check sites like Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy or classical logic resources).\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive and verify each equivalence:  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that \u00ac(A \u2227 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 \u00acB) and \u00ac(A \u2228 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) hold by De Morgan's laws.  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that (A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA) holds by the contrapositive equivalence.  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that (A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 B) is equivalent by material implication.  \n\u2003\u2013 Re-derive (\u00acA \u2192 B) using the transformation for implications: normally, X \u2192 Y is logically equivalent to (\u00acX \u2228 Y). Replacing X with \u00acA gives (\u00ac(\u00acA) \u2228 B), which simplifies to (A \u2228 B); then compare this with (A \u2228 \u00acB).  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that \u00ac(A \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2227 \u00acB) is correct using the negation of the material implication.\n\n\u2022 Conclude that the equivalence (\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB) is not valid when carried out \u2013 because by material implication its left side should be equivalent to (A \u2228 B), not (A \u2228 \u00acB). This logical derivation shows that it is not equivalent to the others.\n\n\u2022 Therefore, the specific statement that does not fit with the valid logical equivalences is:  \n\u2003\u2003(\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB)\n```",

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 Standard logical equivalences and laws, such as:\\n\u2003\u2013 De Morgan's Laws: (lookup in any standard logic textbook or reliable online source such as \u201cWikipedia: De Morgan's laws\u201d)\\n\u2003\u2013 Material Implication: (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acA \u2228 B); (lookup in sources on propositional logic)\\n\u2003\u2013 Contrapositive: (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA); (standard fact available in logic materials)\\n\u2003\u2013 Negation of Implication: \u00ac(A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (A \u2227 \u00acB); (verify in propositional logic texts)\\n\u2022 Reference information on the transformation of conditionals with a negated antecedent, to assess whether (\u00acA \u2192 B) is indeed equivalent to (A \u2228 \u00acB). (Could check sites like Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy or classical logic resources).\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 Derive and verify each equivalence:  \\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that \u00ac(A \u2227 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 \u00acB) and \u00ac(A \u2228 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) hold by De Morgan's laws.  \\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that (A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA) holds by the contrapositive equivalence.  \\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that (A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 B) is equivalent by material implication.  \\n\u2003\u2013 Re-derive (\u00acA \u2192 B) using the transformation for implications: normally, X \u2192 Y is logically equivalent to (\u00acX \u2228 Y). Replacing X with \u00acA gives (\u00ac(\u00acA) \u2228 B), which simplifies to (A \u2228 B); then compare this with (A \u2228 \u00acB).  \\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that \u00ac(A \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2227 \u00acB) is correct using the negation of the material implication.\\n\\n\u2022 Conclude that the equivalence (\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB) is not valid when carried out \u2013 because by material implication its left side should be equivalent to (A \u2228 B), not (A \u2228 \u00acB). This logical derivation shows that it is not equivalent to the others.\\n\\n\u2022 Therefore, the specific statement that does not fit with the valid logical equivalences is:  \\n\u2003\u2003(\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB)\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_2', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'python_interpreter', 'arguments': 'final_answer(\\\"(\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB)\\\")'}}]\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Call id: call_2\\nObservation:\\nExecution logs:\\nLast output from code snippet:\\n(\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB)\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\\nRead the above conversation and output a FINAL ANSWER to the question.

Facts to look up\n\u2022 Standard logical equivalences and laws, such as:\n\u2003\u2013 De Morgan's Laws: (lookup in any standard logic textbook or reliable online source such as \u201cWikipedia: De Morgan's laws\u201d)\n\u2003\u2013 Material Implication: (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acA \u2228 B); (lookup in sources on propositional logic)\n\u2003\u2013 Contrapositive: (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA); (standard fact available in logic materials)\n\u2003\u2013 Negation of Implication: \u00ac(A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (A \u2227 \u00acB); (verify in propositional logic texts)\n\u2022 Reference information on the transformation of conditionals with a negated antecedent, to assess whether (\u00acA \u2192 B) is indeed equivalent to (A \u2228 \u00acB). (Could check sites like Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy or classical logic resources).\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive and verify each equivalence:  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that \u00ac(A \u2227 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 \u00acB) and \u00ac(A \u2228 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) hold by De Morgan's laws.  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that (A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA) holds by the contrapositive equivalence.  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that (A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 B) is equivalent by material implication.  \n\u2003\u2013 Re-derive (\u00acA \u2192 B) using the transformation for implications: normally, X \u2192 Y is logically equivalent to (\u00acX \u2228 Y). Replacing X with \u00acA gives (\u00ac(\u00acA) \u2228 B), which simplifies to (A \u2228 B); then compare this with (A \u2228 \u00acB).  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that \u00ac(A \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2227 \u00acB) is correct using the negation of the material implication.\n\n\u2022 Conclude that the equivalence (\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB) is not valid when carried out \u2013 because by material implication its left side should be equivalent to (A \u2228 B), not (A \u2228 \u00acB). This logical derivation shows that it is not equivalent to the others.\n\n\u2022 Therefore, the specific statement that does not fit with the valid logical equivalences is:  \n\u2003\u2003(\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB)\n```",
