On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7.

DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search!

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task asks for a single count: the number of times a Twitter/X post is cited as a reference.  \n\u2022 The count must be broken down by day (i.e. for each day) for August.  \n\u2022 \u201cEnglish Wikipedia pages\u201d are the target of the search for these citations.  \n\u2022 The versions of the Wikipedia pages to be examined are the \u201clast June 2023 versions.\u201d  \n\u2022 The task clearly states that there is a correct answer, and it implies that all necessary tools and sources are available.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 A complete list or dump of English Wikipedia pages as they appeared in their last June 2023 revisions.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Look up the June 2023 Wikimedia database dumps or page history logs.  \n\u2022 The exact citation patterns or URL formats that identify a Twitter/X post reference.  \n\u2003 \u2013 Check Wikipedia\u2019s citation guidelines and common template usage (for example, reference templates for tweets) on Wikipedia or Wikimedia help pages.  \n\u2022 The extraction method for determining the day (in August) associated with a Twitter post.  \n\u2003 \u2013 This may involve looking up guidelines on how tweet dates are rendered in citation templates; consult documentation on citation templates used for Twitter/X posts on Wikipedia.  \n\u2022 Any clarifications about what \u201ccited as a reference\u201d means in this context (e.g. does it include only inline citations? Are there special cases such as archived versions?)  \n\u2003 \u2013 Verify with Wikimedia documentation or previously published methodologies for counting references.  \n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 From the June 2023 versions of all English Wikipedia pages, derive a filtered set of reference elements or citations that point to Twitter/X posts by matching the appropriate URL or template patterns.  \n\u2022 For each of these Twitter/X citations, derive the tweet\u2019s publication date (or the associated day) as provided in the citation data.  \n\u2022 Aggregate and count the number of times such citations appear for each day in August (e.g., grouping by day and summing up occurrences).  \n\u2022 Infer or simulate any necessary extraction logic, queries, or parsing routines to produce the final count.\n```",
