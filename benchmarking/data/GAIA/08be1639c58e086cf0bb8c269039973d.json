Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task asks for the EC numbers of the two most commonly used chemicals for the virus testing method.  \n\u2003Reasoning: We know that the answer requires EC numbers tied to specific chemicals used in virus testing.  \n\u2022 The chemicals are mentioned in a paper about SPFMV and SPCSV in the Pearl Of Africa from 2016.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The paper serves as the source for both the virus testing method and the identification of the chemicals.  \n\u2022 The answer must be returned as semicolon-separated EC numbers in the order corresponding to the alphabetized names of the chemicals.  \n\u2003Reasoning: A correct final answer requires sorting the chemical names alphabetically before displaying their matching EC numbers.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Details of the referenced paper: Title, authors, publication venue, and access location (e.g., a research database or digital library).  \n\u2003Reasoning: To identify the two most commonly used chemicals, one must first locate and access the paper \u201cabout SPFMV and SPCSV in the Pearl Of Africa from 2016.\u201d\n\u2022 The chemicals used in the virus testing method as described in the paper.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The paper will specify which chemicals are used; from these, the two most commonly used must be identified.\n\u2022 The EC numbers corresponding to the identified chemicals.  \n\u2003Reasoning: After finding the chemicals in the paper, one must either locate within the paper or use an appropriate chemical/enzyme database (such as the BRENDA enzyme database or a similarly relevant source) to look up their EC numbers.\n\u2022 Clarification on what \u201cEC numbers\u201d refer to in this context (for instance, whether they are Enzyme Commission numbers or another classification).  \n\u2003Reasoning: It is important to understand precisely what the \u201cEC number\u201d means for the chemicals in question to ensure the correct data is retrieved.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Identification of the two most commonly used chemicals for the virus testing method from the paper.  \n\u2003Reasoning: From a careful reading of the paper, one needs to derive which chemicals are used most frequently or are highlighted as most important in the protocol.\n\u2022 Assignment or extraction of the appropriate EC numbers for these two chemicals based on the found details or additional lookup.  \n\u2003Reasoning: Once the chemicals are known, one must logically derive (or look up) their corresponding EC numbers.\n\u2022 Sorting of the two chemical names in alphabetical order and then ordering their corresponding EC numbers accordingly, separated by a semicolon.  \n\u2003Reasoning: The final answer requires the EC numbers be arranged based on the alphabetical order of the chemicals\u2019 names before being formatted into the answer output.\n\n\n```\n\nNow begin!

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
