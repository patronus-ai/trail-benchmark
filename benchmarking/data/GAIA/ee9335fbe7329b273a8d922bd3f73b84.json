Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.</p>\\n<p class=\"basetext\">Meanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.</p>\\n<p class=\"basetext\">Hence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.</p>\\n<p class=\"basetext\">In the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby\u2019s \u201ctummy is full you must'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_9wLvCO8W0I5DxP1ihqqUsQjT', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'inspect_file_as_text', 'arguments': {'file_path': 'https://journal.finfar.org/articles/127.pdf', 'question': 'Please extract the passage from Emily Midkiff\u2019s June 2014 article (F\u00e1fnir) that contains the specific word quoted from two different authors in criticism of dragon depictions.

However, the file ends before reaching page\\xa041, where Midkiff\u2019s article would be found.

This means that the full text of Midkiff\u2019s article, including the critical passage with the specific quoted word (which is cited as coming from two different authors expressing distaste for dragon depictions), is not present.\\\\n\\\\nThe bibliographic details confirmed from the file include:\\\\n\u2022 Journal Title: Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research\\\\n\u2022 Volume/Issue: Volume 1, Issue 2 (June 2014)\\\\n\u2022 Publisher/Organization: The Finnish Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (FINFAR)\\\\n\u2022 Online address: journal.finfar.org\\\\n\\\\nWithout access to the complete article text starting from page 41, it is not possible to locate the passage or verify that the quoted word indeed expresses distaste for dragon depictions.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nThe request aimed to identify a passage where two critics\u2019 opinions (quoted within the article) converge on using a specific word that criticizes dragon depictions. Unfortunately, as the complete text for Midkiff\u2019s article is not provided, we cannot extract the excerpt or confirm the details of the quotation. If you have access to the full version of the article or can provide additional text from page 41 onward, I would be able to further pursue extracting and confirming the specific passage and corresponding bibliographic details.'}}}]\"}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",

Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['numpy', 'json', 'datetime', 'PyPDF2', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'stat', 'time', 'requests', 'torch', 'fractions', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'collections', 'sympy', 'pubchempy', 'pandas', 'os', 'csv', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 're', 'Bio', 'unicodedata', 'queue', 'PIL', 'itertools', 'random', 'xml', 'math', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'io', 'statistics']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['numpy', 'json', 'datetime', 'PyPDF2', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'stat', 'time', 'requests', 'torch', 'fractions', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'collections', 'sympy', 'pubchempy', 'pandas', 'os', 'csv', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 're', 'Bio', 'unicodedata', 'queue', 'PIL', 'itertools', 'random', 'xml', 'math', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'io', 'statistics']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

This means that the full text of Midkiff\u2019s article, including the critical passage with the specific quoted word (which is cited as coming from two different authors expressing distaste for dragon depictions), is not present.\n\nThe bibliographic details confirmed from the file include:\n\u2022 Journal Title: Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research\n\u2022 Volume/Issue: Volume 1, Issue 2 (June 2014)\n\u2022 Publisher/Organization: The Finnish Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (FINFAR)\n\u2022 Online address: journal.finfar.org\n\nWithout access to the complete article text starting from page 41, it is not possible to locate the passage or verify that the quoted word indeed expresses distaste for dragon depictions.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe request aimed to identify a passage where two critics\u2019 opinions (quoted within the article) converge on using a specific word that criticizes dragon depictions. Unfortunately, as the complete text for Midkiff\u2019s article is not provided, we cannot extract the excerpt or confirm the details of the quotation. If you have access to the full version of the article or can provide additional text from page 41 onward, I would be able to further pursue extracting and confirming the specific passage and corresponding bibliographic details.",

Search within the article\u2019s text for the section containing the passage with the quoted word (using keyword queries like \u201cdragon\u201d or phrases indicating criticism) to identify the specific excerpt.\n5. Extract and verify the quoted word that appears from two different authors, ensuring it is used in a context expressing distaste for dragon depictions.\n6. Confirm through contextual reading that the punctuation or phrasing around the quoted word criticizes dragon depictions.\n7. Compile a detailed summary including: a short version of the task outcome, an extensive detailed explanation (including the bibliographic record and the clear excerpt from the article), and any additional contextual information.\n8. Use final_answer to provide the complete final answer with all mentioned parts.\n\n\n```",

Extract the surrounding text of the quotation to capture all context that confirms the negative or critical tone toward dragon depictions.\\n4. Identify and collect all the bibliographic information available on the webpage (title, publication date, volume/issue numbers if present, page numbers, and any DOI or similar reference).\\n5. Analyze the extracted passage to confirm that the quoted word indeed is used to express distaste for dragon depictions and to note the reference to the two different authors.\\n6.

Therefore, for my purposes here, it is significant to note that the parent is performing the language, the pre-literate child the eyes, and picture books already encourage a binary between these two age extremes. This dual performance brings the characteristics of the dragon uncomfortably close to home by doubling not only the people with the dragons but also the parent/child with one another.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Adults and children are doubled and divided by the very practice in which they engage through picture books: literacy. John Morgenstern points out ever since children and adults were separated by the rise of schooling and the Victorian Cult of Childhood, children have been regarded by adults as another type of being that is simultaneously the same and different, innocent and barbaric (21-22). In <em>Hush, Little Dragon</em>, the parent and child readers each absorb the mother and child dragon identities, simultaneously taking on the dragon-humanity doubling and this cultural Othering between adults and children over the practice of reading.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">As the performers of language, the reading parent becomes the mother dragon. Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Meanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Hence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">In the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby\u2019s \u201ctummy is full you must",

Scroll through the article to locate the passage where two different authors are cited with a common \"quoted word\" in relation to dragon depictions, possibly by searching for quotation marks or the exact term \u201ctricksy\u201d if it appears.\n3. Extract the surrounding text of the quotation to capture all context that confirms the negative or critical tone toward dragon depictions.\n4. Identify and collect all the bibliographic information available on the webpage (title, publication date, volume/issue numbers if present, page numbers, and any DOI or similar reference).\n5. Analyze the extracted passage to confirm that the quoted word indeed is used to express distaste for dragon depictions and to note the reference to the two different authors.\n6. Assemble all the gathered details (bibliographic record and the excerpt containing the quotation) into a final comprehensive answer.\n7. Use final_answer to provide a short summary, an extremely detailed account, and any additional context.\n\n\n```",

Therefore, for my purposes here, it is significant to note that the parent is performing the language, the pre-literate child the eyes, and picture books already encourage a binary between these two age extremes. This dual performance brings the characteristics of the dragon uncomfortably close to home by doubling not only the people with the dragons but also the parent/child with one another.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Adults and children are doubled and divided by the very practice in which they engage through picture books: literacy. John Morgenstern points out ever since children and adults were separated by the rise of schooling and the Victorian Cult of Childhood, children have been regarded by adults as another type of being that is simultaneously the same and different, innocent and barbaric (21-22). In <em>Hush, Little Dragon</em>, the parent and child readers each absorb the mother and child dragon identities, simultaneously taking on the dragon-humanity doubling and this cultural Othering between adults and children over the practice of reading.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">As the performers of language, the reading parent becomes the mother dragon. Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Meanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Hence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">In the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby\u2019s \u201ctummy is full you must ",

Short answer\n\nUnfortunately, the file provided does not include the full text of Emily Midkiff\u2019s article \u201cDragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature\u201d (June 2014, Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research, Vol.\u202f1, Issue\u00a02, starting on page\u00a041). Therefore, I cannot extract any passage\u2014including one containing the specific quoted word\u2014from Midkiff\u2019s article.\n\n2. Extremely detailed answer\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the provided file, I found that it contains the front matter, submission details, editorial content, and two complete peer\u2010reviewed articles (by Jari K\u00e4kel\u00e4 on \u201cManaging and Manipulating History: Perpetual Urgency in Asimov and Heinlein\u201d and by Kaisa Kortekallio on \u201cIntuitive Technologies: Models of Posthuman Subjectivity in Simon Ings\u2019 Hot Head and Hotwire\u201d). The table of contents at the beginning lists three articles, with the third being \u201cDragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature\u201d by Emily Midkiff. However, the file ends before reaching page\u00a041, where Midkiff\u2019s article would be found. Consequently, the passage you are requesting\u2014the one featuring a specific word (quoted from two different critics of dragon depictions, used to express distaste towards certain representations of dragons) along with its surrounding context\u2014is not available in the text provided. \n\nBibliographic details available from the file are as follows:\n\u2022 Journal Title: Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research  \n\u2022 Volume/Issue: Volume 1, Issue 2 (2014)  \n\u2022 Publisher/Organization: The Finnish Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (FINFAR)  \n\u2022 Online address: journal.finfar.org  \n\u2022 The table of contents indicates that Emily Midkiff\u2019s article \u201cDragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature\u201d appears following page 40 (presumably beginning on page 41) in this issue.\n\nSince the full text of Midkiff\u2019s contribution is not included in the file you supplied, I am unable to isolate and provide the requested passage along with its context.\n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked\n\nYour question asks for the extraction of a passage from Emily Midkiff\u2019s June 2014 article that features a particular word\u2014a word reportedly quoted from two different critics who express distaste towards how dragons are depicted in children\u2019s literature. Such a passage would have included surrounding context confirming that the term is used critically. While the table of contents confirms that Midkiff\u2019s article is part of this issue (and thus should discuss dragon depictions in children\u2019s literature), the file you provided only contains complete text for the earlier articles and stops before Midkiff\u2019s work appears. \n\nWithout the segment from page 41 onwards (where Midkiff\u2019s article begins), I cannot extract the passage you requested or verify the bibliographic and contextual details regarding the use of that quoted word. If you have access to the complete issue or the full text of Midkiff\u2019s article, please provide that portion so I can accurately extract and present the passage in question.",

Therefore, for my purposes here, it is significant to note that the parent is performing the language, the pre-literate child the eyes, and picture books already encourage a binary between these two age extremes. This dual performance brings the characteristics of the dragon uncomfortably close to home by doubling not only the people with the dragons but also the parent/child with one another.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">Adults and children are doubled and divided by the very practice in which they engage through picture books: literacy. John Morgenstern points out ever since children and adults were separated by the rise of schooling and the Victorian Cult of Childhood, children have been regarded by adults as another type of being that is simultaneously the same and different, innocent and barbaric (21-22). In <em>Hush, Little Dragon</em>, the parent and child readers each absorb the mother and child dragon identities, simultaneously taking on the dragon-humanity doubling and this cultural Othering between adults and children over the practice of reading.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">As the performers of language, the reading parent becomes the mother dragon. Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">Meanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">Hence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">In the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby\u2019s \u201ctummy is full you must\"}]}], \"stop_sequences\": [\"Observation:\"], \"grammar\": null, \"tools_to_call_from\": [\"<scripts.text_web_browser.SearchInformationTool object at 0x131f66450>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.VisitTool object at 0x131f67ed0>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.PageUpTool object at 0x131cb0590>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.PageDownTool object at 0x1142424d0>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.FinderTool object at 0x1026f2ed0>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.FindNextTool object at 0x131f66e50>\", \"<scripts.text_web_browser.ArchiveSearchTool object at 0x131f642d0>\", \"<scripts.text_inspector_tool.TextInspectorTool object at 0x131f66010>\", \"<smolagents.default_tools.FinalAnswerTool object at 0x102720150>\"], \"kwargs\": {}}",

Therefore, for my purposes here, it is significant to note that the parent is performing the language, the pre-literate child the eyes, and picture books already encourage a binary between these two age extremes. This dual performance brings the characteristics of the dragon uncomfortably close to home by doubling not only the people with the dragons but also the parent/child with one another.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Adults and children are doubled and divided by the very practice in which they engage through picture books: literacy. John Morgenstern points out ever since children and adults were separated by the rise of schooling and the Victorian Cult of Childhood, children have been regarded by adults as another type of being that is simultaneously the same and different, innocent and barbaric (21-22). In <em>Hush, Little Dragon</em>, the parent and child readers each absorb the mother and child dragon identities, simultaneously taking on the dragon-humanity doubling and this cultural Othering between adults and children over the practice of reading.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">As the performers of language, the reading parent becomes the mother dragon. Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Meanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Hence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">In the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby\u2019s \u201ctummy is full you must",

Short answer\n\nUnfortunately, the file provided does not include the full text of Emily Midkiff\u2019s article \u201cDragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature\u201d (June 2014, Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research, Vol.\u202f1, Issue\u00a02, starting on page\u00a041). Therefore, I cannot extract any passage\u2014including one containing the specific quoted word\u2014from Midkiff\u2019s article.\n\n2. Extremely detailed answer\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the provided file, I found that it contains the front matter, submission details, editorial content, and two complete peer\u2010reviewed articles (by Jari K\u00e4kel\u00e4 on \u201cManaging and Manipulating History: Perpetual Urgency in Asimov and Heinlein\u201d and by Kaisa Kortekallio on \u201cIntuitive Technologies: Models of Posthuman Subjectivity in Simon Ings\u2019 Hot Head and Hotwire\u201d). The table of contents at the beginning lists three articles, with the third being \u201cDragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature\u201d by Emily Midkiff. However, the file ends before reaching page\u00a041, where Midkiff\u2019s article would be found. Consequently, the passage you are requesting\u2014the one featuring a specific word (quoted from two different critics of dragon depictions, used to express distaste towards certain representations of dragons) along with its surrounding context\u2014is not available in the text provided. \n\nBibliographic details available from the file are as follows:\n\u2022 Journal Title: Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research  \n\u2022 Volume/Issue: Volume 1, Issue 2 (2014)  \n\u2022 Publisher/Organization: The Finnish Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (FINFAR)  \n\u2022 Online address: journal.finfar.org  \n\u2022 The table of contents indicates that Emily Midkiff\u2019s article \u201cDragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature\u201d appears following page 40 (presumably beginning on page 41) in this issue.\n\nSince the full text of Midkiff\u2019s contribution is not included in the file you supplied, I am unable to isolate and provide the requested passage along with its context.\n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked\n\nYour question asks for the extraction of a passage from Emily Midkiff\u2019s June 2014 article that features a particular word\u2014a word reportedly quoted from two different critics who express distaste towards how dragons are depicted in children\u2019s literature. Such a passage would have included surrounding context confirming that the term is used critically. While the table of contents confirms that Midkiff\u2019s article is part of this issue (and thus should discuss dragon depictions in children\u2019s literature), the file you provided only contains complete text for the earlier articles and stops before Midkiff\u2019s work appears. \n\nWithout the segment from page 41 onwards (where Midkiff\u2019s article begins), I cannot extract the passage you requested or verify the bibliographic and contextual details regarding the use of that quoted word. If you have access to the complete issue or the full text of Midkiff\u2019s article, please provide that portion so I can accurately extract and present the passage in question.",

It goes without saying\\nthat speculative fiction gathers various genres under its umbrella. This fact is well illustrated by the\\nthree   articles   published   here,   as   they   move   from   future   histories   of   Isaac  Asimov   and   Robert\\nHeinlein to Ings\u2019 rewriting of the mind and to the uncanny dragons in children\u2019s fiction.\\n\\nHowever,  recognising  the   diversity   of  speculative  fiction   does  not   mean   that   Fafnir  the\\ndragon would just eat up random ingredients and digest them into a meaningless jumble. In all of its\\nmultifacetedness, a pattern emerges.\\n\\nAll in all, our three articles bring forward the wide spectrum of ideas turned over by means\\nof speculative fiction. What if future histories could be managed and manipulated? What if the mind\\ncould be programmed? What if there were dragons? The writers of these articles address, among\\nother things, the potential of asking such speculative questions.\\n\\nJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\u2019s article \u201cManaging and Manipulating History: Perpetual Urgency in Asimov\\nand Heinlein\u201d, discusses in an illustrative manner two important works by the central authors of\\ngolden age of science fiction: Isaac Asimov\u2019s The  Foundation  series and Robert Heinlein\u2019s  The\\nMan Who Sold the Moon. K\u00e4kel\u00e4 sees that while both authors see history as a result of important\\nactions   by   a   few   central   characters,   Asimov\u2019s   \u201cheroes\u201d   are   more   passive,   while   Heinlein\u2019s\\ncharacters are more active and disposed towards creating the change themselves.\\n\\nKaisa Kortekallio, in her article \u201cIntuitive Technologies: Models of Posthuman Subjectivity\\nin Simon Ings\u2019 Hot Head  and  Hotwire\u201d focuses on the novels in order to examine how the texts\\nappropriate and rewrite the idea of the mind as both material and computational. Kortekallio reads\\nIngs\u2019 novels in the context of the theoretical developments within cognitive science, theories of\\ncomplex systems, and posthumanism.\\n\\nIn the third and last article, \u201c\u2018Dragons Are Tricksy\u2019: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s\\nLiterature\u201d,   Emily   Midkiff   discusses   the   representation   of   dragons   in   children\u2019s   literature.   She\\nsuggests that the figure of the dragon has a lot of uncanny potential to address issues linked to\\nhumanity and identity, also in the works aimed for young audiences.\\n\\nIn addition to the articles, P\u00e4ivi V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen brings us the report of the 35th International\\nConference on the Fantastic in the Arts (ICFA) held in Orlando, Florida. V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen praises ICFA for\\nits friendly atmosphere and a program as diverse as the field of speculative fiction.\\n\\nNext issue, Fafnir 3/2014, will be out in September 2014.

Looking at the way these works are\\ninfluenced by the 1940s pulp science fiction context and Astounding Science Fiction\\nmagazine editor John W. Campbell Jr., this article examines their shared sense of\\ncontinuous urgency or impending crisis. This leads to authoritarian solutions and a\\nrecurrent focus on \u201cGreat Man\u201d characters who manipulate the society toward a\\nbetter future with their enlightened awareness of the workings of history. As this\\narticle argues, while the stories justify these manipulations by a sense of urgency,\\nthey also create tensions where the manipulations become only temporary solutions\\nand lead to predetermined futures for all but the power elite.\\n\\nKeywords: Isaac Asimov, Foundation, Robert A.

Both   reflect   also   more   generally   the   spirit   of   the   so-called   \u201cGolden  Age\u201d   of\\nAmerican   science   fiction   in   the   1940s,   greatly   influenced   by   editor   John   W.   Campbell   Jr.   of\\nAstounding Science Fiction, arguably the most influential pulp SF magazine of the time. Stories by\\nboth Asimov and Heinlein frequently involve enlightened engineers who actively shape history and\\nbypass democratic processes, and as I argue, in this they repeatedly convey a sense of history as a\\nstate of perpetual urgency and crisis where great individuals must rise to the occasion and take\\nactive control of the course of events.\\n\\nWhile   history,   especially   in  Asimov\u2019s   larger   work,   also   connects   with   themes   such   as\\nfrontier   and   guardianship,   the   present   article   will   focus   on   the   early   parts   of  Asimov\u2019s   and\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\\n\\nManaging and Manipulating History\\n\\nHeinlein\u2019s series, only briefly pointing out the further and diverging examples of the authors\u2019 other\\nconnected works.1\\n\\nAuthoritarianism is a commonly acknowledged strain in Campbellian science fiction (see\\ne.g. Easterbrook, Kilgore, Abbott), frequently seen to be based in social Darwinism and reliance on\\nmeritocracy (Smith, Tucker, McGiveron, and Berger). It seems that these ideas are activated and\\njustified   through   an   Enlightenment-inspired   necessity   of   contemplating   history   and   societal\\ndynamics. But as that contemplation often seems to result in a sense of impending crises, I argue\\nthat these stories share an unspoken assumption of a state of urgency which justifies emergency\\nmeasures, and as such already postpones any serious consideration of more democratic, and slower,\\noptions in building societies and reaching solutions that would lead to the survival of humankind as\\na whole.2\\n\\nAlthough both Asimov\u2019s and Heinlein\u2019s larger story sequences take a consciously historical\\napproach, Asimov\u2019s work is based on idealization of a rather somber Enlightenment spirit, while\\nHeinlein\u2019s stories are more pluralistic and satirical. Regardless, especially the stories set at the early\\nstages of both future histories seem to be rooted in a view of history which requires leadership by\\nthe select few at moments of great urgency, even if they also view history as a series of larger\\ndevelopments which most individuals cannot affect \u2013 unless they are among the few who possess a\\nsuperior understanding of those historical forces.\\n\\nCampbellian Science Fiction and History\\n\\nThe future histories of Asimov and Heinlein were both first published as serials in  Astounding\\nScience Fiction  magazine during the time when John W. Campbell Jr. had assumed its editorship\\nand  was  consciously  seeking  to  raise  the  \u201crespectability\u201d  of  the  genre  by trying  to harness   its\\nspeculative   potential   (Chapledaine  et   al.).   In   his   editorials   and   critical   writing   Campbell   also\\nemphasized the predictive aspirations of science fiction as a field for thought experiments that were\\nhighly relevant to his contemporary society (Campbell, \u201cPlace of SF\u201d 20), fostering a sense of\\nliterature   that   addressed   audiences   \u201cwho   felt   they   had   an   immediate   stake   in   the   technosocial\\ndisruptions that were remaking a world\u201d (Csicsery-Ronay 81). As Csicsery-Ronay notes, \u201c[d]oing\\nso it jettisoned many of the aesthetic and historical axioms of the Western culture\u201d (ibid.), which in\\npart led to more conscious attention on the role of  history in the stories, and to the \u201csocial science\\nfiction\u201d that considered the impact of science on human culture in general (Asimov, \u201cSocial Science\\nFiction\u201d 157\u2013196).\\n\\nThe characters in these works of Golden Age science fiction use their knowledge of history\\nto more effectively manipulate and maneuver the present towards their desired future. This results\\nin a very pragmatic and utilitarian conception of history and societal dynamics where history is\\nknowledge, and knowledge is power \u2013 bringing about a direct need to learn from the past to build\\nthe future. The idea of actively steering the course of the future is apparent also in Campbell\u2019s\\neditorials where he claims for SF authors a role in shaping the future. It is a deliberate message of\\ntechnological   optimism,   characteristic   of   Campbell\u2019s   desire   to   see   science   fiction   as   a   kind   of\\ncontinuation of the Renaissance. Campbell\u2019s introduction to the 1953 Astounding Science Fiction\\n\\n1      In this article I present a part of the argument in my forthcoming dissertation The Cowboy Politics of an Enlightened Future:\\nHistory, Expansionism and Guardianship in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, which will deal with Asimov\u2019s series on the whole, including\\nthe interconnected Robot and Foundation stories. Here I focus on Foundation (1951), the first part of the book-form publication of\\nthe series which originally appeared in  Astounding  in 1942\u20131950. I have discussed Asimov\u2019s frontier themes also for example in\\nK\u00e4kel\u00e4 (2008).\\n2       Berger (discussed below) comes close to this crisis-bound idea. Hassler talks about Asimov\u2019s Enlightenment resonances\\nmore generally and Miller looks at Asimov\u2019s work as attempts to solve the utilitarian calculation problems of maximizing the\\nwell-being of the masses.\\n\\n8\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n\\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\\n\\nISSN: 2342-2009\\n\\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 7\u201322\\n\\nAnthology sums up many of the arguments from his editorials. He views SF as a literature which\\ncan help to conceptualize and develop further the early 20th-century \u201cTechnological Revolution\u201d\\nbecause it is\\n\\nthe literature of the technological era. It, unlike other literatures, assumes that change is the\\nnatural order of things, that there are goals ahead larger than those we know. That the motto\\nof the technical civilization is true: \u201cThere must be a better way of doing this!\u201d (Campbell,\\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d xiii)\\n\\nIn Campbell\u2019s vision, this extends into something that would have an impact on the \u201cmethod of\\nliving together; a method of government, a method of thinking, or a method of human relations\u201d\\n(ibid.). This is all a staple of the technological optimism that the \u201cnew literature\u201d would address,\\nstudying history in order to extrapolate on new ways to build on the past. Campbell\u2019s ideas of the\\n\u201cTechnological   Era\u201d   reflect   an   almost   Comtean   positivism   where   knowledge   of   history   has   an\\nintegral role in the transition from the Enlightenment, or what Comte called \u201cmetaphysical\u201d stage,\\nto the truly scientific, positive stage.\\n\\nIn   his   promotion   of   science   fiction,   Campbell   sees   the   \u201cold\u201d   literature   in   the   dawning\\nTechnological Era as \u201cbitter, confused, disillusioned and angry . . . stories of neurotic, confused and\\nessentially homeless-ghost people; people who are trying to live by conventions that have been\\nshattered and haven\u2019t been able to build new ones\u201d (xiv). In contrast to this, he posits the \u201cnew\\nliterature\u201d of science fiction as more able to effectively take up large themes, and to acknowledge\\nand deal with change as a permanent part of human life and the world. It will \u201ctell of goals and\\ndirections and solid hope,\u201d providing for a \u201cstability of a compass needle that points always to the\\npole it never attains, but knows surely is there\u201d (ibid.). In this rhetoric of optimism and constant\\nprogress, Campbell argues for \u201cdynamic stability that lies in going instead of in being\u201d (ibid.).\\n\\nThe sense of science fiction as first and foremost an ongoing dialogue of ideas has carried to\\nthe present for example in the discussions of hard-SF-oriented authors David Brin, Gregory Benford\\nand Greg Bear who added to Asimov\u2019s series with their \u201cSecond Foundation Trilogy.\u201d3 They see\\nthis as a process where they \u201crevisit\u201d the assumptions of the older works and add to the discussion,\\neven if it is, in their view, often misunderstood in criticism as \u201csharecropping\u201d on each other\u2019s ideas\\n(Bear 22, 30\u201331). This is what also Csicsery-Ronay refers to with his concept of the SF \u201cmegatext\u201d\\nwhich emphasizes the communal aspect of the genre and the \u201cshared subcultural thesaurus\u201d created\\nby all of its texts  (Csicsery-Ronay 77n4, 82\u201384). In his view \u201cSF texts are not autonomous; they\\ndepend on each other for comparison, dialogue, the grounding and elaboration of ideas\u201d (84). This\\nview approaches the works expressly from within the genre and the fandom, and emphasizes the\\nrole   of   the   readers\u2019  (and   authors\u2019)   competence   in   the   genre   at   the   same   time   as   it   slightly\\nparadoxically praises the universality of the genre\u2019s approach. All in all, the key point here is the\\nconsideration of science fiction as thought experiments where new theories are built in dialogue\\nwith the old. From the readers\u2019 letter columns in Campbell\u2019s  Astounding  to the present criticism,\\nthis   discussion   seeks   to   view   the   thought   experiments   of   science   fiction   as   something   like   a\\nsimulation of using the scientific method in actual science.4\\n\\nIn conjunction with these ideas, Delany places the Campbellian Golden Age in context with\\nthe   discoveries   of   Einstein   and   others   who   showed   that   extensive   scientific   revolutions   were\\n\\n3      Rather than further conceptualize the series, Brin, Benford and Bear update some of Asimov\u2019s ideas with more recent science\\nand fill in gaps in the already existing narrative. They do not venture beyond the events in  Foundation and Earth, the novel set in the\\nlatest events of Asimov\u2019s fictional world, nor do they consider what the completed collective consciousness of Galaxia would look\\nlike.\\n4      This emphasis on the ability of science fiction to provide a vehicle for the ideas sometimes leads to seeing more mainstream\\nliterary criticism as merely something that gets in the way of the thought experiments, which are often perceived as the genre's most\\nimportant aspect. This is apparent already in Campbell\u2019s ideas on the \u201cnew literature,\u201d as he effectively aims for an active and\\nintegral role for science fiction in the sphere of societal and political discourse, but not in the sphere or art.\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\\n\\nManaging and Manipulating History\\n\\npossible.  According   to   Delany,   this  \u201ctheoretical   plurality\u201d  inspired   a   critique   of   the   popular\\nconception   of   science,  and   the   resulting   constant   \u201cfictive   theoretical   revision\u201d   challenged   what\\nmodern science at the time considered impossible (Delany 221). As a result, investigating various\\nviews   of   history   became   one   more   thought   experiment,   leading   to   \u201chistorical   plurality\u201d   in\\nCampbellian science fiction as it brought history and societal development into the realm of theories\\npotentially to be revolutionized by new discoveries (226).\\n\\nThere are, however, also much more pessimistic interpretations: for example Berger sees the\\nworks of Campbellian science fiction to exhibit a world-view centered on desperately opposing the\\ndecay implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics which dictates a descent into entropy. In his\\nview, much of Campbellian science fiction becomes an (often frustrated) attempt to fight against\\nthis impending chaos by recurrently authoritarian methods, and the works do not look as hopeful as\\npresented in Campbell\u2019s own rhetoric (Berger 14\u201315).5 Still, at the same time as Berger makes an\\nimportant   point   in   criticizing   the   works   of   Campbellian   Golden  Age   for   the   simplification   of\\nscientific   and   historical   processes   and   for   the   resulting   authoritarianism,   he   also   rather\\nheavy-handedly concludes that \u201cthe ultimate inevitability of entropy made Campbell a determinist\\nabout human history\u201d (17). As a result, Berger\u2019s own analysis largely downplays the curious tension\\nbetween these gloomy prospects and the \u201cproblem-solving, activism, optimism; hope . . . in the\\nright kind of people to master their physical environment,\u201d which Berger sees as mere denial of the\\nlosing   battle   (ibid.).  After   all,   even   if   the   solutions   posited   by   Campbellian   SF   are   at   times\\nmeritocratic,   authoritarian   and   brutally   utilitarian,   they   still   represent   the   continued   survival   of\\nhumankind \u2013 and while they betray distrust in the intelligence of the masses and at times  see\\ndemocracy as a hindrance to progress, they nevertheless also exhibit a certain optimism and belief\\nin the human ability to come up with new answers in the future.\\n\\nHeinlein and Asimov both highlight the spirit of the Campbell era, as well as make use of a\\nspecific frontier ethos. Heinlein based the outline of his Future History series on the history of\\nAmerican expansion and projected the frontier past rather directly onto the near future (see also\\nSamuelson 32\u201363), often exaggerating certain aspects of the American frontier mythos (and ethos)\\nto satirical proportions. His future history outline progresses from \u201cThe Crazy Years\u201d of the 1940s\\nEuropean collapse and \u201cconsiderable technical advance\u201d in the US to space exploration consciously\\nmodelled   on   American   frontier   expansion   in   \u201copening   of   new   frontiers   and   a   return   to\\nnineteenth-century   economy\u201d   (The   Past   Through   Tomorrow  660\u2013661).   This   then   turns   into\\n\u201cImperial Exploitation\u201d and develops through \u201crevolutions,\u201d \u201cextreme puritanism,\u201d and \u201creligious\\ndictatorship\u201d into the \u201c[r]e-establishment of civil liberty\u201d and \u201c[r]enascence of scientific research\u201d\\nwhich enables yet another move toward the stars (ibid.). Populating this timeline with stories that\\nare only loosely connected, Heinlein created a fairly pluralist mosaic view of the future history of\\nhuman advance into space.\\n\\nIn contrast, Asimov\u2019s series offered a view of encompassing sweeps of future history which\\nunfolded as a unified story, and transmitted a sense of a mythical grand narrative of all humanity,\\nemploying an encyclopedic flavor akin to Edward Gibbon\u2019s The History of the Decline and Fall of\\nthe Roman Empire  (1776\u20131789) which was the initial inspiration behind the desire to write, as\\nAsimov himself describes it, \u201ca science fiction story that  read  like a historical novel\u201d (I, Asimov\\n116\u2013117, original emphasis). This historical approach opened vast conceptual possibilities, and also\\nturned from the analogies of Roman history into analogies of the American history of expansionism\\nand theorizations on the significance of the frontier in the American development, as I have argued\\nelsewhere (\u201cAsimov\u2019s Foundation\u201d).\\n\\n5     Berger criticizes Campbellian SF as \u201cincreasingly misanthropic and elitist\u201d with a deeply rooted distrust in the human faculty\\nwhich leads to authoritarianism because \u201cthe masses cannot be trusted to govern themselves\u201d (32). This leads to \u201cthe forceful\\noppression of certain kinds of change, at least for all but an elite.\u201d Berger sees this as a frustration arising from the attempt to reduce\\nproblems to their essentials in the spirit of the scientific method, when history or society cannot be so reduced (31).\\n\\n10\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n\\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\\n\\nISSN: 2342-2009\\n\\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 7\u201322\\n\\nHeinlein\u2019s stories concentrate on individuals and local concerns, and connect to his own\\npresent through detailed references to American frontier history, as well as satirical exaggerations of\\nlaissez-faire capitalism (Tucker 189\u2013190) and political manipulation. Although Asimov\u2019s work, too,\\nincludes  political manipulation and plutocratic plotting, in his series  they are represented more\\nsimply as societal trends, and the stories are inhabited by characters who take an active role as they\\nnot only try to understand the past but also seek to transform that understanding into action. Despite\\nthe fact that Asimov\u2019s series focuses on mostly one character per story, it manages to create a feel of\\na panoramic view of the history of a society as it changes. While Heinlein focuses on individual\\ncharacters at crucial points in his future history, Asimov\u2019s work builds a grand narrative that covers\\nthe future history of the whole of the human species.\\n\\nAs   I   discuss   in   the   following,   the   conceptions   of   history   in   the   works   of  Asimov   and\\nHeinlein become apparent through the motifs of urgency and the \u201cGreat Men\u201d of history who rise to\\nthe task of managing that situation, and succeed through their ability to view history in a way that\\nenables them to base their manipulations on it.\\n\\nWorlds of Perpetual Urgency and Determinism for the Masses\\n\\nMany of the Golden Age writers were infatuated with the idea of the Enlightenment and presented\\nstreamlined versions of it in their stories under Campbell\u2019s editorship, reflecting his positivism and\\nfaith in the power of science and technology. However, this faith is often shadowed by cynicism in\\nterms of politics and the importance of individual rights, veering in its ideals toward enlightened\\ndespotism. The early 20th-century context was one of the sources for the desire in American SF,\\ninspired by the new scientific discoveries, to fight against the seemingly impending chaos brought\\nabout by the social upheavals, depression, war and fascism of the 1930s (Berger 14\u201315). In this,\\nmuch of the Campbellian science optimism can be seen as attempts to navigate through the societal\\nentropy   and   to   maintain   a   precarious   balance   on   the   brink   of   chaos.   Even   as  Asimov\u2019s   series\\nprogresses rather optimistically from one crisis to another, it also exhibits a nervous urgency of\\nfighting off that impending chaos6 (in a very concrete manner as psychohistory is trying to shorten\\nthe coming \u201cDark Age\u201d of the galaxy), and a certain awareness that things can very easily slip into\\nthis  nearly irredeemable state. All of this  creates the need for authoritarian control, which will\\nenable the corrective  action. All in all, Asimov and Heinlein both explore various aspects of the\\nmotif of conspiracy or elite control (Clareson 30, Abbott 108, Palumbo 49\u201364), justified by the\\nurgency of the historical situation.\\n\\nIn the Foundation series the character of Hari Seldon becomes a purveyor of the perpetual\\nurgency   under   which   the   Foundationers   constantly   work.   In   his   recorded   appearance   at   the\\nFoundation   \u201cTime  Vault\u201d   fifty   years   after   its   establishment   in   exile   from   the   Galactic   Empire,\\nSeldon sets the stage for the crises to come:\\n\\nFrom now on, and into the centuries, the path you must take is inevitable. You will be faced\\nwith a series of crises. . . .\\n\\nBut whatever devious course your future history may take, impress it always upon\\nyour descendants that the path has been marked out, and that at its end is [a] new and greater\\nEmpire! (Foundation 80\u201381)\\n\\nSeldon\u2019s message casts the Foundationers as \u201cthe seeds of Renascence and the future founders of\\nthe Second Galactic Empire\u201d (ibid.) whose destiny it is to save the whole of human civilization. As\\n\\n6     Palumbo (2002) focuses on the idea of chaos and fractal symmetry as self-similarity in Asimov\u2019s plot structure. On this basis he\\nconducts an insightful, but still rather conventional reading of the recurring themes in the series, ordered according to his findings on\\nthe plot structure.\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\\n\\nManaging and Manipulating History\\n\\nSeldon repeatedly engages in these crisis-bound conceptualizations of history and future, for the\\nFoundationers his recorded appearances make him a godlike entity behind their national destiny.\\nThe Foundationers are thus immersed in ideas of an urgent duty to expand and redeem the rest of\\nthe galaxy, and this will become the ultimate justification for manipulations when the characters of\\nthe politician Salvor Hardin and businessman Hober Mallow rise to the challenge. When they do,\\nthey are frequently portrayed as the only ones who realize the state of urgency and see the larger\\npatterns of history.\\n\\nWhile Asimov\u2019s heroes assume power at states of emergency, Heinlein\u2019s heroes remain more\\nambivalent. Still, also Heinlein\u2019s very openly manipulative protagonist, D.D. Harriman in \u201cThe\\nMan Who Sold the Moon,\u201d argues that he needs to be in control of the moon flights because only he\\ncan be the moral guardian of the possibilities that they produce:\\n\\nHandled right, it can mean a new and braver world. Handle it wrong and it\u2019s a one-way\\nticket  to Armageddon.  . .  . I  plan to  be  the  Man  in the  Moon myself\u2013\u2013and  give it my\\npersonal attention to see that it\u2019s handled right. (Heinlein 146)\\n\\nBoth Asimov\u2019s and Heinlein\u2019s characters repeatedly assume a position of guardianship over society\\nas they take responsibility and guide all of humanity despite their personal interests. As Harriman\\nputs it early on in Heinlein\u2019s story: \u201cthere is nothing in this world so permanent as a temporary\\nemergency\u201d (123). It is this urgency that calls for the \u201cGreat Men\u201d of history to step up, and the\\nnarratives of both Asimov and Heinlein build on a conception of history which focuses on these\\nfigures.\\n\\nIn this, the masses are often left in the background. The fact that \u201cthe path has been marked\\nout\u201d   raises   the   discussion   of   determinism   in  Asimov\u2019s   series.   While   for   example   Elkins   sees\\nAsimov\u2019s   psychohistory   as   essentially   distorting   ideas   of   historical   materialism   to   a   cyclical\\nconception of history (96\u2013110), Freedman more recently views psychohistory as reducing Marxism\\nand   Freudian   psychoanalysis   to   nineteenth-century   positivism   which   assumes   the   masses   to   be\\ncompletely passive. This leads to \u201cinvesting of all meaningful agency in an elite and aloof clerisy\u201d\\n(Freedman, \u201cRemembering the Future\u201d 133\u2013134). Indeed, Asimov\u2019s \u201cnecessary assumption[s]\u201d of\\npsychohistory do demand this, as the human reaction stimuli must be kept constant for the whole\\ntheory   to   work   (Foundation  20).   On   the   other   hand,   the   problems   of   this   reduction   are\\nacknowledged already in Asimov\u2019s series as it continues: as human history cannot be simplified in\\nsuch a mechanistic way, this sends Asimov on an infinite course of trying to patch up the problems\\ncreated by his previous solutions. Along these lines, Delany has noted that the series in fact comes\\nclose to the spirit of the scientific method when it seeks to address these problems in later stories,\\nthus engaging in a dialogue with ideas presented in the earlier stories (see Delany 223-227). In his\\nview,   the   latter   half   of  Asimov\u2019s   original   trilogy   \u2013   the   stories   with   the   Seldon-Plan-disrupting\\ncharacter of \u201cMule,\u201d and the scientific community of the Second Foundation who try to fix the Plan\\nafter him \u2013 questions this determinism and positivism, in effect delivering a two-part message that\\n\u201chistory is intellectually negotiable but not deterministically predictable\u201d (Delany 223\u2013225).\\n\\nHowever, it seems to me that all of this overlooks the point that history in Asimov\u2019s series is\\nnever   really   deterministic   in   the   first   place.   Psychohistory   is   a   statistical   tool   that   will   reveal\\ntendencies and probable developments, but that information is always used by someone to initiate\\nsome action. These initiating agents \u2013 nearly always a power elite, comprised of however few\\npeople   \u2013   retain   their   freedom   of   action   and   the   direction   chosen   becomes   a   matter   of   their\\nreasoning. Their actions may effectively result in determinism for the masses, but in this curious\\nmixture of looking at the masses through the power elite, the masses fade into the background. In\\npsychohistory, the social sciences are extrapolated into the realm of hard sciences, and history itself\\nbecomes a set of data that can be treated through the methods of the natural sciences. Therefore, it\\n\\n12\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n\\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\\n\\nISSN: 2342-2009\\n\\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 7\u201322\\n\\nbecomes a utilitarian method of taking guardianship over the human future history, to minimize\\nstrife and to try to provide the greatest good for the greatest number of people (see also Miller\\n189\u2013206). As Asimov\u2019s fictional world is ultimately dictated by rationality, there seems to be no\\neffective need for a discussion on the morality of this guarding elite \u2013 their benevolence is as if\\nautomated   by   their   reliance   on   science   and   reason.   Furthermore,   this   same   power   structure   is\\npresent   in  Asimov\u2019s   series   even   in   the   stories   where   the   current   power   elite   operate   without\\nknowledge of psychohistory. Even there similar layers of hidden elite control are present, and rather\\nthan positing that there is no way to affect the course of the future, this possibility can be accessed\\nonly by the very few of a highly select elite, and even they have to struggle to succeed.\\n\\nThus these works exhibit a tension between the two conceptualizations of history which\\nShippey sees in much of science fiction: the \u201cMalthusian\u201d idea that society is bound by technical\\nand   economic   forces   invisible   to   the   individual,   and   the   \u201cmythopoeic,   hero-making\u201d   idea   that\\nhistory progresses purposefully and with definite agency by individuals toward the present which is\\nsuperior to the past (Shippey 6\u20138). While this develops into a more pluralistic view as the narratives\\nof Asimov and Heinlein progress,  Foundation  implicitly and \u201cMan Who Sold The Moon\u201d more\\nobviously emphasize individual actors who are able to take advantage of the Malthusian forces of\\nsociety with their own rational ability.7\\n\\nFreedom and Responsibility of the Great Men\\n\\nEspecially the early part of the Foundation series becomes a sort of a hagiography of the frontier\\nfilibuster,   robber   baron   and   merchant   prince   characters   who   begin   building   the   nation   on   the\\nfrontier. In Asimov\u2019s series, the actions of such characters are easily justified through the urgency\\nset by Hari Seldon\u2019s speech, and even though they do not possess the same knowledge of the future\\nto come as Seldon, they earn their place among the heroes of Foundation history. Their impetus\\nseems to be Thomas Carlyle\u2019s \u201cGreat Man Theory\u201d according to which  \u201cthe history of what man\\nhas accomplished in this world, is at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here\u201d\\n(Carlyle 4). This idea was popularized  in Carlyle\u2019s  On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in\\nHistory (1840), and it becomes one of the leading conceptions of history behind Asimov\u2019s series,\\nand the same is apparent also in several of Heinlein\u2019s works. In fact, a couple of minor characters in\\n\u201cThe Man Who Sold the Moon\u201d even refer to Carlyle explicitly.\\n\\nIn addition to this, the pulp context of Asimov and Heinlein brings in the idea of heroic\\nindividuals who shape the course of history in a way that resonates with the convention of the\\n\u201cuniversal hero,\u201d as analyzed by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949). The\\nthree stages of what he calls a monomyth are \u201ca separation from the world, a penetration to some\\nsource of power, and a life-enhancing return\u201d (35). Just as there is a universal mythic structure of\\nquest in the specifically American cultural myths of \u201csettling the West\u201d and \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d\\n(Mackey-Kallis   17),   the   Great   Man   heroes   of  Asimov   and   Heinlein   become   the   realizers   of   a\\nmythical quest as they transform not themselves but the world around them through the escape \u2013\\ninitiation \u2013 return formula.\\n\\nIn the Foundation series, Hari Seldon is the ultimate Great Man figure as the developer of\\npsychohistory.   The   chapter   \u201cThe   Psychohistorians\u201d   in  Foundation,   opening   the   book-form\\npublication of the series, adds to building the myth as it shows Seldon prophetically mapping out\\n\\n7      The two larger series also contain stories like Heinlein\u2019s \u201cLogic of Empire\u201d and Asimov\u2019s \u201cThe General\u201d in  Foundation and\\nEmpire (originally published as \u201cDead Hand\u201d in May 1945 Astounding) which demonstrate the helplessness of the individual in the\\ngrip of the historical forces. This is in contrast with the maneuverings of the traders and mayors in the early parts of Asimov\u2019s series\\nwhere the characters do steer the society, but much in the way of Heinlein\u2019s heroes do not attempt to go against the flow of history\\nand societal developments. Instead, they harness these forces for their personal advantage at the same time as they work for the\\ncommon good.\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\\n\\nManaging and Manipulating History\\n\\nthe course of the First Galactic Empire\u2019s decline with the certainty of a man with a vision and plans\\ncalculated   by   the   scientific   accuracy   of   \u201cthe   developed   mathematics   of   over   eighteen   years\u201d\\n(Foundation  27). When Seldon is taken to a trial where he has to answer accusations of rousing\\nrebellion against the Empire with his predictions, he is \u201cunperturbed. . . . the only spot of stability\\nremaining in the world\u201d (28). He is the purveyor of \u201cscientific truth [which] is beyond loyalty and\\ndisloyalty\u201d   (29)   and   not   a   puppet   of   the   crumbling   empire   that   challenges   him.   Through\\npsychohistory Seldon is more \u201caware of both the present status and the past history of the Empire\u201d\\n(33) than anyone else, and at the same time he becomes a founding father figure and a Great Man of\\nhistorical importance to all Foundationers.\\n\\nHowever,   while   Seldon\u2019s   messages   may   inspire   the   masses   by   casting   them   as   the\\nprotagonists of a magnificent future, they provide no actual guidance. Rather, they enforce a split\\nbetween those few who understand and control the science and the many who to whom it becomes a\\nmatter of predestination, as discussed above. Only a select few, protagonists like Salvor Hardin and\\nHober Mallow, are able to use their intellect to distance themselves from what seems pure magic\\nand predestination to others, in order to go beyond the shock and awe of the sublime vision and start\\nactively   forwarding   the   Foundation\u2019s   expansionist   mission.   Repeatedly   in  Asimov\u2019s   series,   the\\nGreat Men are found among those who are not mesmerized by the seemingly sublime scope of\\nhistory laid before them, but are instead able to place it in the world of reason and take action (see\\nK\u00e4kel\u00e4, \u201cEnlightened Sense of Wonder?\u201d).\\n\\nSimilar noble aspirations can be found in Heinlein\u2019s characters as well, but equally strong is\\nthe sense of the capable individual\u2019s right to take also personal advantage of the situation. Smith\\n(137\u2013171) and Tucker (172\u2013193) among others have discussed the social Darwinism apparent in\\nmany of Heinlein\u2019s works, and it seems evident that while Heinlein\u2019s stories provide an optimistic\\nview   of   the   possibility   of   human   development,   they   also   open   the   door   to   meritocracy   and\\njustification of authoritarian control by the \u201cfittest\u201d   (Cf. McGiveron 53\u2013548). The adoration for\\nMachiavellian heroes who become significant historical figures through their courage to act upon\\ntheir vision is clearly present in the character of Harriman. At first he seems like a purely capitalist\\nrobber baron on \u201cthe greatest real estate venture since the Pope carved up the New World,\u201d ready to\\nstrike a deal that is \u201clike having Manhattan Island offered to you for twenty-four dollars and a case\\nof whiskey\u201d (Heinlein 132), and operating with a savoir-faire where \u201cthe use of bribe money is a\\nhomeopathic art\u201d (140). Initially Harriman is the fabled American entrepreneur-turned-tycoon with\\na \u201cMidas touch\u201d (134) who makes use of the virgin land rhetoric and frontier parallels only to\\nfurther his business interests. However, as he reveals his larger nation-building vision in direct\\ncomparisons between the history of American independence and the notion of establishing a free\\nstate on the Moon, his plan is shown to be more than a mere plutocratic daydream. Thus Harriman\\nbecomes the lone hero who understands the situation and now his greater goal justifies all of his\\nmanipulations:\\n\\nThe   Moon   was   not   meant   to   be   owned   by   a   single   country,   even   the   United   States.\\n(145\u2013146)\\n\\nI\u2019m   going   to   see   this   thing   developed,   not   milked.

(203)\\n\\n8     McGiveron contests that Heinlein\u2019s Social Darwinism is \u201cnot a celebration of mindless expansionism, but, consistently, a call to\\narms to those who would remain free; he espouses justifiable defense rather than rapacious offense.\u201d In his view, Heinlein\u2019s \u201cidealism\\nand pragmatism temper each other\u201d and produce solutions of mutually tolerated existence instead of purely socially Darwinistic\\n\u201cmindless predatory organisms\u201d (54).

These minor characters function to highlight\\nconsiderations of the historical significance of both the situation of opening the space frontier and\\nthe role of individual Great Men in it. Still, because Harriman\u2019s business partners are themselves\\nnot adept enough to become the historically significant rulers of Carlyle\u2019s hero theory, they stay on\\nthe \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d set in motion by Harriman\u2019s manipulations and rather easily get past their\\nconcerns of him \u201csetting up new imperialism\u201d (186). Even this much concern for the side-effects of\\nmanipulation is something of an exception in these stories, as they frequently idolize the robber\\nbaron figures as the new Western entrepreneurs. The ethos of the stories is that even if the scheming\\nis devious as such, the characters turn into heroes when they contribute to the development of the\\nfrontier nation.\\n\\nHarriman operates in a knowable present with all the possible resources of information and\\nwealth at his disposal, but the Foundation mayor Salvor Hardin has to rely entirely on his own\\nrational ability. His story is set in a moment of utmost urgency as the Foundation\u2019s existence is\\nthreatened   by   the   surrounding   kingdoms,  and   in   this   situation   Hardin   becomes   the   first  of   the\\nFoundation Great Men to begin establishing it as a nation of its own. Hardin is empowered by his\\nown ability and vision as he starts working toward Seldon\u2019s goal by piecing together information\\nabout psychohistory and Seldon\u2019s objectives. While the Foundation Encyclopedists passively wait\\nfor a \u201cdeus ex machina\u201d (Foundation 73) of the Old Empire or Seldon\u2019s calculations to resolve their\\nproblems, in the spirit of Enlightenment, Hardin takes an active role, realizing that \u201cwe must work it\\nout ourselves\u201d (75). At this point he seems to be the only one with at least a suspicion that there\\nmay be a greater whole towards which they should be heading. With his sense of self-reliance, he is\\nable to reproach the Foundation scientists for passively only relying on \u201cauthority or the past \u2013\\nnever on [them]selves\u201d (74). Hardin\u2019s pragmatic self-reliance simply brushes aside any paralyzing\\nawe that his own vague knowledge of Seldon\u2019s plan may evoke, and he gets to work.\\n\\nThe relatively static nature of Asimov\u2019s characters in the  Foundation  series produces this\\ncontradiction: as they correspond at least metaphorically with Joseph Campbell's monomyth, they\\ngo through motions which should cause some change. However, as they are the Great Men who\\npossess a strong sense of mission to begin with, they need no transformations like the reluctant\\nacceptance   of  responsibility,   which   would   be  typical   for   pulp   heroes. As   often   in Asimov,   the\\ncharacters whose actions change the world remain themselves representations of the societal forces,\\nrather than show any individual development \u2013 even if, paradoxically, individualism is one of the\\nforces that they represent.9\\n\\nIn his analysis on the body of Heinlein\u2019s work as \u201cincessant focus on the single individual\\nand his world\u201d (99), Slusser points out a factor which seems the key to the difference between\\nHeinlein and Asimov. Heinlein\u2019s focus on individuals can be seen to rise from a different concern:\\nwhile Asimov uses individual heroes  as emblems of forces that move the society onwards and\\ncreate the future history, with Heinlein the actual individual and his preservation are much more\\nsignificant.   As   Slusser   points   out,   Heinlein\u2019s   work   exhibits   a   \u201cpreoccupation   with   endlessly\\n\\n9      Later on, Asimov\u2019s series does feature also characters whose inherent sense of mission works to show the futility of individual\\naction, as in the case of Lathan Devers in Foundation and Empire.\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\\n\\nManaging and Manipulating History\\n\\nextending the material line of a single existence\u201d (108n), as in his Lazarus Long stories. Although\\nAsimov\u2019s   future  history  is  often  criticized  for  the  stylized  and  interchangeable  characters,  it  is\\nprecisely   this   emblematic   nature   of   the   characters   which   contributes   to   creating   the   sweeping\\nnarration of the large historical movements and societal dynamics. To add to this, Asimov\u2019s heroes\\nare   distinguished   from   Heinlein\u2019s   by   the   way   they   more   easily   accept   the   limitations   of   their\\npersonal existence, and also step down from the seat of power.10\\n\\nWith both Asimov and Heinlein, however, the actual justification for why these specific\\nindividuals should be in control does not seem to be much more than the fact that they happen to\\nrise to the challenge, and be responsible enough to see to it that in addition to accumulating their\\nown wealth, they benefit society (or the \u2018right side\u2019 of it anyway) as a whole. As De Witt Douglas\\nKilgore notes in Astrofuturism: \u201c[i]n Heinlein\u2019s narratives, the right to control new lands and wealth\\nis conferred according to one\u2019s standing in a meritocratic hierarchy\u201d (95; see also Elkins 105). The\\nsame is true of Asimov\u2019s characters whose actions are justified by their awareness of the workings\\nof history,  and their  ability  to take  advantage of them.  This  position  is  authorized through  the\\nlanguage   of   Puritan   election   (Slusser   96\u201398;   Kilgore   94)   even   if   it   is   election   by   capitalistic\\nprowess, not divine election or salvation. Hence, also Heinlein\u2019s Harriman becomes the lone hero\\nwho   directs   humanity.   In   the   words   of   Kilgore:   \u201c[t]he   wonderful   dream   of   new   frontiers   and\\nAmerican renewal . . . is authoritarian even as it professes a rhetoric of egalitarian individualism\u201d\\n(95).   This   tension   between   individual   freedom   and   authoritarianism   and   between   self-serving\\nexploitation and enlightened guardianship is ever present in Asimov and Heinlein.\\n\\nHistorical Awareness and Manipulation\\n\\nOne of the central faculties of Asimov\u2019s and Heinlein\u2019s Great Men seems to be this ability to turn\\nthe understanding of their historical context into practical action (see also Berger 19). As noted\\nabove, this consciousness of history leads to deliberately applying frontier imagery as a means of\\nrejuvenating the culture. This comes across as the necessity of expansion to retain cultural vitality,\\nand links it with Frederick Jackson Turner\u2019s \u201cFrontier Thesis\u201d in Asimov\u2019s case (K\u00e4kel\u00e4, \u201cAsimov\u2019s\\nFoundation\u201d), while in Heinlein\u2019s \u201cThe Man Who Sold the Moon\u201d it appears as a promotion of\\nspace travel in a readily familiar package with easily exploitable connotations of national mission\\nand virility.11\\n\\nAsimov\u2019s   Hardin   becomes   a   Great   Man   through   his   ability   to   self-reliantly   deduce   the\\nFoundation\u2019s point in history and to take advantage of it, but also through his more general ability to\\nform a comprehensive view of the Galaxy\u2019s history. Passages that merge Hardin\u2019s voice with the\\nnarrator\u2019s provide glimpses of historical movement reminiscent of history textbook rhetoric:\\n\\nAnd now that the Empire had lost control over the farther reaches of the Galaxy, these little\\nsplinter groups of planets became kingdoms \u2013 with comic-opera kings and nobles, and petty,\\nmeaningless wars, and a life that went on pathetically among the ruins.

Hence,\\nHardin always seems to be something of an outside observer of the history unfolding before him,\\neven when he steers its events himself.\\n\\nHeinlein\u2019s Harriman, on the other hand, is in the thick of things as he is constantly arguing\\nfor   space   frontier   expansion   that   mirrors   the   American   expansion,   and   his   success   lies   in\\nmaneuvering his way around the obstacles set up by government. The story gets much of its drive\\nfrom following Harriman\u2019s increasingly more imaginative manipulations as he sets up his venture\\nby bribing, lying and bending the letter of law. Key to all of this, however, is the portrayal of\\nHarriman   as   a   character   so   aware   of   history   that   he   consciously   repeats   the   frontier   myth   of\\nAmerican history on the Moon. In a sense, the novum of the story is Harriman\u2019s ability to reiterate\\nthe  American   frontier   myth   as   a   marketing   tool   for   space   exploration,   but   also   to   implement\\nunrestricted power capitalism in its realization.\\n\\nAsimov\u2019s characters are rather serious compared to Heinlein\u2019s merry pack of new frontier\\nrobber   barons,   perhaps   with   the   exception   of   Hober   Mallow   in   the  Foundation  chapter   \u201cThe\\nMerchant Princes.\u201d He embodies the same historical vision and awareness as Salvor Hardin, and his\\nability for management and manipulation are central in the latter half of the novel. After the first\\nsteps in frontier survival represented by Hardin, the Foundation turns to more active conquering\\nthrough commerce. Mallow is a purely capitalist businessman with no pretensions (\u201cMoney is my\\nreligion\u201d Foundation 184), and a readiness to guide a potential customer through \u201cthe workings of\\ndummy corporations\u201d (187) to seal a deal. Still, he becomes another Great Man in Foundation\\nhistory by retaining his position as a \u201cfree agent\u201d (210) and a lone hero, \u201cthe only man who knows\\nhow to fight the crisis\u201d (222) \u2013 thus legitimizing the use of any means necessary. Indeed, Mallow\u2019s\\nrobber baron heroism is in its ambivalence close to Heinlein\u2019s Harriman: he is ultimately doing\\nwhat advances the greater cause of the Foundation, but he is also the one to make the biggest profit\\non the maneuverings that lead to it.\\n\\nEven though the Foundation mayor\u2019s secretary, who becomes Mallow\u2019s adversary, criticizes\\nthe provincial-origin Mallow for not having the \u201csense of destiny\u201d (232) of the Foundationers, by\\nthe end of the story it is clear that Mallow is the one with a greater and an active sense of the\\nhistorical forces at play. He is able to turn the situation to the Foundation\u2019s favor through his vision\\nwhich   is   much  more   than  just   a  passive  sense  of  destiny.   However,   in  this  case   taking   action\\nironically means doing nothing but letting the current crisis run its course, as will happen when the\\nFoundation makes no offensive against the kingdom of Korell that threatens them with war. By his\\nhistorical understanding, Mallow is able to understand what will happen when the Foundation cuts\\nthe trading connections with them:\\n\\nThe whole war is a battle between . . . The [old] Empire [which supports Korell] and the\\nFoundation. . . . To seize control of a world, they bribe with immense ships that can make\\nwar, but lack economic significance.

(231)\\n\\nKnowing that \u201cpeople endure a good deal in war,\u201d Mallow aims for a stalemate during which,\\ninstead   of   wartime   \u201cpatriotic   uplift   of   imminent   danger,\u201d   the   Korellians   will   be   met   by\\naccumulating everyday annoyances as the Foundation-sold technology will begin to fail, and the\\npublic dissatisfaction will lead to their eventual surrender (229).\\n\\nBy this capacity for encompassing vistas of social movement, much like those of Hardin\u2019s,\\nMallow solves the crisis, and this is the redeeming factor of all his brutal economic manipulation\\nwhich in itself does not make him look like much of a hero.

The fact that in the\\nlarger scheme of things Mallow (just like Hardin) is very consciously working for the greater cause,\\ngives a Campbellian moral justification to all the admiration of clever manipulation in the first part\\nof the Foundation trilogy.\\n\\nThis exhibits the typically American active pragmatism and optimism in Campbellian SF\\nwhich solves the problems and masters the environment once \u201cthe right kind of people\u201d are given\\nfreedom to work, but it also betrays the view that someone needs to take over the masses for the\\nsake of their own well-being (Berger 16\u201317). The theme of elite control develops as the general\\npublic is repeatedly shown to be, as Berger notes, \u201cill-informed, prejudiced, and more than willing\\nto follow the manipulative leadership of nearly anyone egotistical enough and sufficiently skilled to\\nstep out in front of the crowd\u201d (20). As these works often take this social dynamic as a given,\\nauthoritarianism becomes also the moral answer: if the masses blindly follow authority in any case,\\nit would be irresponsible to let the less capable assume the authority (see also Easterbrook 53).\\nRecurrently this  amounts  to a willing surrender to the idea that you cannot change the society\\nagainst the flow of history and be personally successful, but you can maneuver your way through it\\nand accumulate personal success.\\n\\nThe parts of Asimov\u2019s and Heinlein\u2019s series discussed here focus on the power elites as they\\nmaneuver the society through its first steps in frontier survival and set up expansionism. However,\\nboth series do feature also characters that are not part of the elite, at least not to begin with. For\\nexample in Asimov\u2019s \u201cSearch by the Foundation\u201d in  Second Foundation  (originally published in\\nDecember 1949 and January 1950 Astounding under the title \u201c\u2013And Now You Don\u2019t\u201d) the teenage\\nprotagonist Arkady Darell helps to defeat the hidden power elite of the Second Foundation, even if\\nthe story ends with a revelation that the First Foundation\u2019s seeming victory is only bluff designed to\\nlet   the   Second   Foundation   continue   its   hidden   control.   Heinlein\u2019s   Future   History   also   features\\ncharacters like the na\u00efve would-be frontier hero in the story \u201cCoventry,\u201d or the unfortunate lawyer\\nin \u201cLogic of Empire\u201d who ends up on the oppressed side of the expansionistic society. At first these\\nstories do in fact seem somewhat critical of the division created by the authoritarian urgency of\\nfrontier management. However, the criticism is brushed aside as the protagonist of \u201cCoventry\u201d\\nreaches a meritocratic redemption of sorts when he accepts responsibility and aspires to become a\\npart of the power elite; and when the lawyer in \u201cLogic of Empire tries to turn attention to the\\nhorrors of the slavery that he managed to escape and is treated as a fool for refusing to see that\\nslavery just happens to be a \u201cnecessary\u201d part of building an empire. Also in those Heinlein\u2019s Future\\nHistory stories which focus on smaller-scale incidents, the society is built along authoritarian and\\nmeritocratic lines and the difficulty of emerging from the underside of society is an important part\\nof validating the individual\u2019s ability. This is evident for example in \u201cMisfit\u201d where an awkward and\\nuneducated working class protagonist turns out to be a mathematical genius who saves the day on a\\nmilitary-run   construction   site   of   the   space   expansion.   Even   here   it   is   the   individual\u2019s   own\\nextraordinary ability that distinguishes him from the masses and grants potential access to the elite.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nIn his  editorials  for  Astounding  Campbell very  consciously gives  science fiction  an active and\\nintegral role in affecting societal development. He echoes Auguste Comte\u2019s aphorism that \u201cfrom\\nscience comes prediction; from prediction comes action\u201d (quoted in Pickering 566) and stresses the\\nimportance of science fiction in anticipating the goals towards which humanity should strive. This\\ncan be seen as a central idea behind many of the Golden Age works.

Berger sees in this the frustration of Campbellian SF authors when they\\n\u201ccannot deliver on their promises of utopia\u201d (29). However, instead of grandiose visions of utopia,\\nthe works seem to exhibit faith in the power of science to come up with at least temporary solutions\\nthat are good enough for the time being, and faith in scientific advance to produce also new ones as\\nthey are needed. Even if it at times seems like a desperate process, it is presented as a well-meaning\\nattempt to save or steer the world. Furthermore, I would contest that while a certain desire for\\nutopia12 exists in the background, rather than frustrated, it is moderated by pragmatism about what\\ncan really be done. This  utopian desire is linked with the conviction that human history needs\\nsomeone enlightened but strong enough to take the wheel because there is no time to arrive at the\\nsame results by democratic processes.\\n\\nAlthough the leadership by Great Men in both authors\u2019 works is supposedly a temporary\\nstate   on   the   way   towards   a   new   stability,   as   the   pattern   of   crisis   management   by   any   means\\nnecessary is repeated, it illustrates the view of history as a perpetual urgency where the ideals of\\ndemocracy are indefinitely put on hold. As the frontier society of Asimov\u2019s Foundation is built and\\nmanaged through the crises and toward the new Galactic Empire, the characters seek justification in\\nthe greater good for all humanity. Heinlein\u2019s representation, on the other hand, is more ambivalent\\nand provides more of a satirical commentary on his contemporary world that extends into future by\\nrepeating the patterns of past events. Heinlein is at times uneasily walking the line between satire\\nand libertarian jingoism, and much more than in Asimov, in his work the sense of urgency is created\\nthrough one character\u2019s vision of what is good for all humanity \u2013 often indistinguishable from their\\nprofit-seeking actions in a caricatured world of  laissez-faire  market economy. Nevertheless, also\\nthere the ability to understand and make use of history at a moment of urgency becomes a key\\ncomponent of the story.\\n\\nEspecially   in   Asimov\u2019s  Foundation  series,   the   idea   of   enlightened   engineers   leads   to\\ncontradictions at every turn. His grand narrative of humanity in the future results in tension between\\nseveral elements, complicating the all-encompassing vista which it seeks to build. This is repeatedly\\nseen through dichotomies that exist between the concept of history that Asimov\u2019s works seem to\\nimply, and the Enlightenment idea of progress. Finally, Asimov\u2019s work points toward a tension\\nbetween the Enlightenment freedom and the increasingly overpowering idea that society needs a\\nmechanism to keep it on the right course \u2013 something that surpasses democracy, autocracy, or any\\n\u2018regular\u2019 forms of governing.13 Still, the point remains essentially the same: forces of history are too\\nhaphazard to be left to carry out their course on their own: humanity as a whole needs some kind of\\nguardianship to guide it through the ever-present crises.\\n\\nAs I have argued, the Carlylean conception of Great Man history leads to narratives that\\nfocus on the management skills and ingenious ways of manipulation devised by robber barons and\\nmerchant princes, and projects worlds where history is made in backroom deals by power elites that\\nclaim to work for the benefit of the masses. In the end, it seems that the ideas of authoritarianism\\nand determinism in Campbellian science fiction are a mixture of Enlightenment ideals, positivism\\nand optimism with regard to possibilities of scientific advance, all tempered with cynicism about\\nthe   nature   of   human   government   and   history.   The   crisis-centered   and   authoritarian-steered\\nconception of history and societal dynamics enables the Great Men to take control, but it also forces\\n\\n12          Jameson   (2007)   and   Freedman   (2000)   talk   about   the   unattainable   nature   of   the   utopia   which   critical   utopias   have   to\\nacknowledge, and while Asimov\u2019s work is rather far from this, it nevertheless circles around similar issues and in its own pragmatic\\nway problematizes the whole idea of building utopias.\\n13     This is something that Asimov begins exploring in Foundation\u2019s Edge and Foundation and Earth with the idea of a galaxy-wide\\ncollective consciousness, Galaxia.\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\\n\\nManaging and Manipulating History\\n\\nthem to work tirelessly to find the most immediately effective ways of managing the course of\\nhumanity.

In Ings'\\ncyberpunk fiction, the use of a particular novum, a programmable cerebral tissue\\ncalled \u201cdatafat\u201d, enables elaborate experimentation on different theories of mind\\nand matter. Due to this experimentation, Ings\u2019 work is able to convey a conception\\nof cognition as an  emergent  effect produced  in  material  processes  that are both\\nhuman and non-human. Ings\u2019 work asserts the human subject as a complex system\\nin a complex technological ecology and, consequentially, presents us with a model\\nfor subjectivity that might be called \u201cposthuman\u201d.\\n\\nKeywords: Simon Ings, Hot Head, Hotwire, posthuman subjectivity, posthumanism, philosophy of\\nneuroscience in literature, complex systems in literature\\n\\nBiography and contact info: Kaisa Kortekallio is a doctoral student in the Doctoral Programme for\\nPhilosophy, Arts and Society at the University of Helsinki.

The   capitalized   \u201cMan\u201d   no   longer   provides   a   useful   model   for\\nidentification   \u2013   rather,   there   is   an   acute   need   for   non-anthropocentric   models   of   thought   and\\npractice. In search of a functional model of operating in the complex technological, ecological and\\nsocial environments, many people turn to science \u2013 and scientists, such as deGrasse Tyson, who can\\ncraft information into intuitively meaningful sentences.\\n\\nSome people take the additional step of approaching science through cultural criticism. The\\nparadigmatic   shift   from   humanist   and   idealist   models   of   thought   to   scientific   and   materialist\\nthinking has not passed humanists unnoticed:  it is the driving force behind many contemporary\\nphilosophical   approaches,   such   as   the   different   critiques   of   classical   humanism   (see   Soper,\\nSheehan),   and   interdisciplinary   work   in   fields   such   as   ecocriticism,   cognitive   literary   studies,\\nDarwinist literary studies, literature and science, animal studies and feminist science studies (see\\n\u00c5sberg   et   al   222).   Conversations   about   the   ideologies   and   assumptions   present   in   scientific\\ndiscourse and practices have been lead for decades by critics such as N. Katherine Hayles, Evelyn\\nFox Keller and Donna J. Haraway.\\n\\nStill, there is more work to be done. One of the areas that call for a more detailed mapping is\\nthe construction and mutation of subjective experience, especially in the literature most interested in\\nthe scientific mode of thought: science fiction. In contemporary philosophy, there are innumerable\\ntheoretical approaches to subjectivity, and the modern and postmodern representations of subjective\\nexperience have been thoroughly studied in scholarship focusing on \u201cmainstream\u201d literary fiction.\\nThe study of science fiction, however, has not taken up the challenge in quite the same way \u2013 partly\\ndue   to   the   preconception   that   science-fictional   characters   are   not   interesting,   philosophically\\nspeaking.  They have been dubbed  as flat rather than round, types rather than individuals, mere\\ndevices for presenting ideas and plot (see Mandala 119\u2013124, Jones 171).\\n\\nThis may be true in many cases. However, there are works of science fiction that speculate\\nnot only about technological progression or scientific theories, but also about the potential and\\nalternative developments of human subjectivity. I suggest that in the early novels of British writer\\nSimon Ings, subjectivity is rewritten in particularly interesting ways. Ings' novels Hot Head (1992)\\nand Hotwire (1995), combining technological speculation and gritty milieus with neurophilosophy\\nand metafictional narration, can be characterized as late cyberpunk. Although Ings has been lauded\\nas an original voice in the field of science fiction (and later as a writer of postmodern fiction closer\\nto the literary mainstream)  his work has not previously received attention from critics within the\\nacademy.\\n\\nThe  primary goal of the article  is to show how  ideas derived from second-order systems\\ntheory and cognitive science are involved in the represented experience of fictional characters, and\\nhow this process relates to the concept of \u201cposthuman\u201d In particular, I focus on analyzing how the\\nmodel of subjects as complex systems evokes a sense of posthuman subjectivity. I argue that 1)\\nscience   fiction   literature   is   essential   for   understanding   the   on-going   reassessment   of   human\\nsubjectivity in relation to non-human systems, and 2) that Ings\u2019 novels  Hot Head  and  Hotwire\\nprovide a particularly profound model of posthuman subjectivity. All in all, the article is an attempt\\nat applying a posthumanist approach to the study of literature.\\n\\nThe method of analysis in this article is far from perfect. There are brilliant analytical tools\\nand concepts developed in cognitive narratology and cognitive stylistics, and utilizing them would\\ndefinitely   provide   a   deeper   understanding   of   represented   experience.   However,   at   the   time   of\\nconducting my analyses, I was still unsure of the ideological underpinnings of these approaches,\\nand wanted to avoid blind commitment to traditions. As a result, except for the occasional use of\\nnarratological   concepts,   the   reading   follows   loose   intuitive   logic   based   on  metaphorical   and\\nanalogical thinking.

This   logic   is   inspired   by   the   insightful   readings   made   by   N.\\nKatherine Hayles (in How We Became Posthuman) and Sherryl Vint (in Bodies of Tomorrow).\\n\\nThe   questioning  also   employs   a  phenomenological  mode:   what   could   it   mean,   on   the\\nexperiential   level,   to   be   posthuman?  I   approach   fictional   characters   as   potential   models   for\\nsubjectivity \u2013 as experimental positions for a curious reader. I am well aware that this immersive\\napproach   involves   the   risk   of   antropomorphizing   textual   constructs.   I   find   the   risk   not   only\\nacceptable,   but   necessary.   For   me,   the   reflective   flickering   between   alternative   perspectives   \u2013\\nreading characters as people and as processes \u2013 is an integral part of the job description of a literary\\nresearcher.\\n\\nThe  article involves a heavy load of references to scientific theorization. Even though my\\napproach allows for no in-depth analysis of most theoretical aspects, I find it necessary to work\\ntowards  a synthesis  that involves perspectives  from both natural sciences and humanities.  This\\nstance is dictated by the source material at hand: in order to fully appreciate the complexity of this\\nsort of science fiction, the research needs to be informed by a multitude of approaches. In his\\nfiction, Simon Ings samples the theories of complex systems and cognition and integrates them into\\na   postmodern   literary   narrative.   To   leave   out   the   natural-scientific   aspect   of   this   elaborate\\nconstruction would be neglectful. By utilizing multiple perspectives \u2013 provided by second-order\\nsystems theory,  the  philosophy of neuroscience and posthumanist theory \u2013 I also hope to convey\\nsome of the challenges ingrained in the posthumanist mode of thought.\\n\\nPosthumanist Thought and the Search for Posthuman Subjectivities\\n\\nThe crisis of humanism has informed new conceptions of embodied human subjects \u2013 as biological\\nand phenomenological, social and environmental beings. In recent years, theorization identifying as\\nposthumanist has worked towards modeling subjectivity in ways that can acknowledge the many\\nroles non-human entities and systems play in the formation of subjectivity. Posthumanist models of\\nsubjectivity  have   drawn   on   both   the   tradition   of   systems-theoretical   (cybernetic)   thinking   and\\npoststructuralist philosophical discourse. As a result, the models often emphasize the processual and\\nmaterial aspects of subjectivity.\\n\\nDespite differences in disciplinary background and methodology, the common ground for\\ncontemporary posthumanist thinkers seems to be the critique of certain dualist and idealist strains in\\nthe tradition of humanism. Whether posthumanist thinking focuses on questions of nonhuman and\\nanimal   agency   and   the   feminist   critique   of   scientific   practices   (see   \u00c5sberg   et   al.)   or   the\\nsystems-theoretical approaches to culture and fiction (Clarke, Posthuman Metamorphosis; Wolfe),\\nthere   is   an   ongoing   search   for   theories   and   models   of   subjectivity   that   can   articulate   life,\\nconsciousness, action and emotion in materialist and non-anthropocentrist terms. In this search,\\nposthumanist thinkers often engage in conversation with natural sciences and technology studies\\n(with variable amounts of interdisciplinary critique). The tradition of interdisciplinarity goes back to\\nthe early development of cybernetics in the 1940s, and especially to the Macy Conferences that\\nbrought together scholars from fields ranging from psychology and anthropology to mathematical\\nphysics and information technology (see Hayles, Clarke and Hansen).1\\n\\nThe \u201cpost\u201d in \u201cposthumanism\u201d should not be considered as a total break from the tradition\\nof   humanism,   but   as   a   critical   deconstruction   of   it   \u2013   in   the   sense   of   Lyotard\u2019s   paradoxical\\n\\n1      Another major current of influence to posthumanist thought consists of the work of materialist and empiricist philosophers \u2013\\nfrom Leibniz, Hume and Spinoza to Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari. This genealogy has lead to coining the term \u201cnew materialism\u201d,\\nreferring to a philosophical approach intertwined with posthumanist thought. Posthumanist discussions (especially the strains that\\nemphasize animal ethics) are also closely linked to different forms of cultural activism such as the animal rights movement and deep\\necology.   For   two   exemplary   accounts   on   genealogies   of   posthumanism,   see   Neil   Badmington's   introduction   to   the   reader\\nPosthumanism and the editors\u2019 introduction to NORA Magazine's issue on \u201cpost-humanities\u201d.\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\fKaisa Kortekallio\\n\\nModels of Posthuman Subjectivity\\n\\npostmodernism   that   happens   both   before   and   after   modernism   (Wolfe   xiv-xv)   or   as   a   critical\\nposition inescapably rooted in humanist assumptions and language (Rabinowitz 42\u201343).  In Cary\\nWolfe\u2019s formulation, posthumanism happens \u201cbefore\u201d humanism\\n\\nin the sense that it names the embodiment and embeddedness of the human being in not just\\nits   biological   but   also   its   technological   world,   the   prosthetic   coevolution   of   the   human\\nanimal with the technicity of tools and external archival mechanisms (such as language and\\nculture) . . . and all of which comes before that historically specific thing called 'the human'\\nthat Foucault's archaelogy excavates (xv).2\\n\\nOn   the   other   hand,   posthumanism   happens   \u201cafter\u201d   humanism   as   the   historical   phenomenon   of\\nreconceptualizing the human as entangled in technological, medical, informational and economic\\nnetworks \u2013 and the call for a new paradigm of thought to account for these entanglements (xv-xvi).\\n\\nOften (but not always) the posthumanist discussion is centered around the term \u201cposthuman\u201d\\n\u2013 both as a general adjective implying a mode of thought and practice that rewrites the meaning of\\nthe   word  \u201chuman\u201d  and   as   a   speculative   figure,  \u201cthe   posthuman\u201d  In   both   syntactic   forms,   the\\nposthuman evokes a plethora of alternatives to current models of humanity and subjectivity. In the\\ndiscussions emphasizing the liberating aspects of technology, the posthuman is a futuristic figure\\nthat   has   transcended   the   boundaries   of   nature,   finitude   and   biological   embodiment:  \u201cthe   fully\\ntechnologized successor species to organic Homo sapiens\u201d (Graham 9).  This transhumanist notion\\nof   inevitable   advent   of   the   superhuman   is   what   Elaine   Graham   wanted   to   question   with   her\\nformulation \u201cpost/human\u201d, to which she attributes a dual function: \u201cThe post/human is that which\\nboth confounds but also holds up to scrutiny the terms on which the quintessentially human will be\\nconceived\u201d (11). The dual function makes the post/human an analytical device, a shifting node in a\\ndynamic   web   of   conversation.   This   nonessentialist   view   has   been   quite   popular   among\\nposthumanist scholars after Graham's formulation. It is also what makes the term posthuman \u2013 even\\nwithout   the   cautionary   forward  slash  \u2013  so  useful   for  philosophical  discussion.  In  posthumanist\\nthought, \u201cposthuman\u201d denotes above all a change in conceptualizing human subjectivity.\\n\\nIn this article, the use of the terms \u201cposthuman\u201d and \u201cposthuman subjectivity\u201d carries the\\nfull   weight   of   the   contexts   and   functions   discussed   above   \u2013   and   hopefully   adds   to   it.  Adding\\n\u201csubjectivity\u201d to \u201cposthuman\u201d is in itself quite problematic, as  R. L. Rutsky, among others, has\\nnoted. \u201dThe subject\u201d has traditionally signified the one in control, the ruler of a world of objects. To\\ncontrol or to be controlled, to be the subject or an object \u2013 this dualism has prevailed. According to\\nRutsky, overcoming this dualism is a central challenge to posthumanist thought:\\n\\n[T]he human subject can only conceive of itself in opposition to the random, just as it seeks\\nto control the body, dominate the material world, and narrativize history. On the other hand,\\nany notion of the posthuman that is to be more than merely an extension of the human, that\\nis to move beyond the dialectic of control and lack of control, superhuman and inhuman,\\nmust be premised upon a mutation that is ongoing and immanent. From this perspective,\\nthere can be no such thing as a posthuman subject - at least, not in the traditional sense of an\\nindividualized, unitary and autonomous subject. (Rutsky 111.)\\n\\nThe problem of posthuman subjectivity is also approached in second-order systems theory \u2013 or, as\\nBruce  Clarke  and Mark  B. N. Hansen  prefer  to  call  it,  neocybernetics.  Neocybernetics, highly\\nuninterested   in   individualized   subjects,   shifts   the   emphasis   of   observation   to   the   networks   of\\nconnections among systems and environments, both living and nonliving. From this perspective, the\\nsubject   appears   to   be   only   a   convention   of   Western   metaphysics,   \u201can   amalgamation\u201d   or   a\\n\\n2     Andy Clark would even claim that this very openness to \u201cmultiple mergers and coalitions\u201d is what distinguishes Homo sapiens as\\na species (Natural Born Cyborgs 7).\\n\\n26\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n\\fKaisa Kortekallio\\n\\nISSN: 2342-2009\\n\\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 23\u201340\\n\\n\u201cnoumenal unity\u201d which deserves no further attention. (Hansen 6.) It is important to note that in\\nsystems theory, the definition of a system always involves selection: the boundaries that define a\\nsystem   such   as   \u201ca   human   individual\u201d   are   dependable   on   the   question   you   want   to   ask.   For   a\\nneocyberneticist, the subject is only a matter of distinction: instead of an individual, one can decide\\nto focus on the various psychic and social systems that constitute an individual, or on the interaction\\nand   collaboration   between   an   individual   and   its   environment.   The   individual   is   dividable   and\\nmergeable. What makes this shift of emphasis urgent in the eyes of the neocyberneticists is the\\nincreasing complexification of the living environment.\\n\\nIn   today's   computational   world,   countless   instances   of   human   agency   \u2013   even   those   as\\nmundane   as   making  online  credit   card  and   mortgage  payments,   monitoring   information\\nabout the weather or the stock market, even writing letters and sending messages \u2013 occur\\nagainst   the   backdrop   of   complex  computational   infrastructures,   which  geographer   Nigel\\nThrift has christened with the felicitous name of the \u201ctechnological unconscious\u201d. (Hansen\\n117.)\\n\\nFor   Hansen,   the   central   challenge   for   contemporary   cultural   theorists   involves   the   inevitable\\nhybridity   of   systems   and   environments:   how   to   both   recognize   the   certain   consistency   of   the\\n\u201chuman mindbody\u201d and to  account  for the certain  non-autonomy  resulting  from its  reliance  to\\ninformationally complex environments (ibid.). Hansen's proposal for accounting for this dynamic is\\nthe concept of \u201csystem-environment hybrids\u201d or \u201cSEHs\u201d couplings that \u201crealize their autonomy . . .\\nthrough a constitutive relation with alterity\u201d. In SEHs, the environmental component cannot be\\nconsidered as merely supportive of or trivial to the system. (115.)\\n\\nIn   cultural   theory,   the   unavoidable   and   constitutive   relation   to   the   (technological)\\nenvironment   has   been   approached   through   concepts   such   as   the   cyborg   and   the   hybrid.\\nNeomaterialist   theorist  Rosi   Braidotti   addresses   the   contingency   of   systemic   boundaries   by\\nsuggesting that the formation of subjectivity (on an experiential level) also involves a process of\\ndistinction   and   selection.  In  Braidotti\u2019s   poetic   formulation,   the   experience   of   any   unitary\\nsubjectivity, of a grammatical  \u201cI\u201d, is a  \u201cfictional choreography\u201d  (Metamorphoses  22). Braidotti\\nwrites:\\n\\nThe subject is a process, made of constant shifts and negotiations between different levels of\\npower and desire, that is to say wilful choice and unconscious drives. Whatever semblance\\nof unity there may be, is no God-given essence, but rather the fictional choreography of\\nmany levels into one socially operational self. (Ibid.)\\n\\nIn this line of thought, every self is fictional \u2013 constructed and operated according to models or\\nschemas   that   are,   in   turn,   constructed   and   transformed   by   social,   cultural,   psychological   and\\nbiological   forces   (Metamorphoses  13).  Despite   the   notion   of   fictionality,   Braidotti   still   sees\\nsubjectivity as a valuable ethical and political category. She even promotes the idea of \u201calternative\\nfigurations\u201d   or  conceptual   personae  (in   the   deleuzian   sense)   as   empowering   or   affirmative\\n\u201csignposts for specific geopolitical and historical locations\u201d (Posthuman  164). The constructivist\\nview on subjectivity can be used as an opportunity for intentional change.\\n\\nConsidered together, these theories pose a challenge. Even if one  accepts  the idea of  the\\nsubject as a process or an effect produced in the network of multiple systems and environments,\\nwill it always remain just that \u2013 an idea, an intellectual exercise? Can the posthumanist models of\\nsubjectivity actually be experienced subjectively? And, translated into a problem specific for the\\nstudy of literature: can these models ever take the form of an identifiable literary character, when\\ncharacters tend to be just that: individualized, unitary and autonomous, caught in the dialectic of\\ncontrol and lack of control?\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\fKaisa Kortekallio\\n\\nModels of Posthuman Subjectivity\\n\\nThese   questions   call   for   a   deeper   analysis   of   the   relations   between   the   traditions   of\\nhumanism and modernity and the conventional form of literary character \u2013 a continuation of the\\nwork already started by such scholars as Daniel Punday, Genie Babb and David Porush. However,\\ndue to the restrictions of time and format, I must now approach them with a more thematic reading\\nof Simon Ings' novels Hot Head and Hotwire. I start with an introduction to the representations of\\nnon-human systems and cognition in cyberpunk literature.\\n\\nCyberpunk and Cognitive Science\\n\\nIn   English-language   popular   culture,   non-human   intelligence   has   traditionally   been   depicted   as\\nthreatening \u2013 whether it resides in technological, institutional or biological systems. The relation\\nbetween a human individual and a non-human system has typically been that of opposition. Just\\nthink of such iconic fictions as Brave New World or The Matrix \u2013 both setting the original human\\npersonality against a nonpersonal threat. The function of the hero has been to resist assimilation\\n(even when it is futile) and retain his individuality at all costs. In science-fictional literature, notable\\nreactions to the apparent rise of non-human systems are paranoia about origins, as in Philip K.\\nDick's and William S. Burroughs' oeuvres (see Butler), and a form of escapism that hovers between\\ntechnophilia   and   technophobia,   as   in  gibsonian   cyberpunk.3  As   a   counterreaction   to   the\\nanthropocentric   heroism   of   1970\u2019s   sf   literature,   the   genre   of   cyberpunk   problematized   the\\nrelationship   between   human   subjects   and  their   technological   others.  In   particular,   it   mockingly\\nquestioned the position of Man as the master of both nature and technological systems. For the\\ncyberpunk protagonist, this often meant the loss of autonomy and control \u2013 and in some cases, also\\nthe loss of a unitary self-image. (See McGuirk, Slusser, Bukatman.)\\n\\nCyberpunk is often regarded as particularly hostile towards embodiment and materiality.\\nMany  cyberpunk   texts  depict  the  self-dissolving   integration  to   computing  systems   as   a  sort  of\\nnirvana,   as   liberation   from   the   constraints   of   flesh.   As   many   critics   have   noted,   this   is   a\\ntranshumanist view \u2013 it seeks not to decentralize or redefine the human subject but to extrapolate on\\nit, resulting in superhuman or inhuman figures, not posthumans. (See Hayles, Wolmark, Parikka.)\\nAs Carol McGuirk has noted, the most novel feature of cyberpunk as a subgenre was its orientation\\ntowards the interior: whereas the tradition of \u201chard science fiction\u201d sent its ships to explore outer\\nspace, cyberpunk turned to examine the vulnerable inner space of the human mind (114\u2013115). This\\norientation is apparent also in Ings\u2019 work. What sets him apart from most cyberpunk writers is his\\nremarkable   interest   towards   phenomenological   embodiment   and   cognitive   science.   Indeed,   in\\nreading Ings, a basic understanding of recent developments in cognitive science  appears not only\\nuseful but crucial. Therefore, a short summary is needed.\\n\\nIn  the  classical theory of mind, the brain is the seat of human consciousness: a central\\ncommander, the subject in a world of objects. However, recent models have also emphasized the\\nembodied  and  environmental  aspects of cognitive activity, decentering the rational and conscious\\nself.  Andy Clark summarizes this process as a three-stage progression: The first stage (classical\\ncognitivism) depicted the mind in terms of a central logic engine, symbolic databases and some\\nperipheral \u201csensory\u201d models. The key characteristics of this vision included the ideas of memory as\\nretrieval from a stored symbolic database, problem solving as logical inference and cognition as\\ncentralized. The environment was seen just as a problem domain and the body as an input device.\\nThe  connectionist  view   replaced   these   characteristics   with   the   ideas   of   memory   as   pattern\\n\\n3      Of course, opposition is not the only way of articulating relations between humans and non-human systems in science fiction.\\nThere are literary works, such as Octavia E. Butler's Xenogenesis series, that posit the human subject as an integral part of a larger\\ntechno-biological   ecology   \u2013   works   that   do   not   determine   subjectivity   through   modern   notions   of   originality,   individuality   and\\nautonomy. In Butler's texts, human subjectivity is produced in social and ecological processes. In this regard, Simon Ings'  Hot Head\\nand Hotwire are similar to Butler's work.\\n\\n28\\n\\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\\n\\n\\fKaisa Kortekallio\\n\\nISSN: 2342-2009\\n\\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 23\u201340\\n\\nre-creation, problem solving as pattern completion and pattern transformation, and cognition as\\nincreasingly  decentralize\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Now answer the question below.

It goes without saying\nthat speculative fiction gathers various genres under its umbrella. This fact is well illustrated by the\nthree   articles   published   here,   as   they   move   from   future   histories   of   Isaac  Asimov   and   Robert\nHeinlein to Ings\u2019 rewriting of the mind and to the uncanny dragons in children\u2019s fiction.\n\nHowever,  recognising  the   diversity   of  speculative  fiction   does  not   mean   that   Fafnir  the\ndragon would just eat up random ingredients and digest them into a meaningless jumble. In all of its\nmultifacetedness, a pattern emerges.\n\nAll in all, our three articles bring forward the wide spectrum of ideas turned over by means\nof speculative fiction. What if future histories could be managed and manipulated? What if the mind\ncould be programmed? What if there were dragons? The writers of these articles address, among\nother things, the potential of asking such speculative questions.\n\nJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\u2019s article \u201cManaging and Manipulating History: Perpetual Urgency in Asimov\nand Heinlein\u201d, discusses in an illustrative manner two important works by the central authors of\ngolden age of science fiction: Isaac Asimov\u2019s The  Foundation  series and Robert Heinlein\u2019s  The\nMan Who Sold the Moon. K\u00e4kel\u00e4 sees that while both authors see history as a result of important\nactions   by   a   few   central   characters,   Asimov\u2019s   \u201cheroes\u201d   are   more   passive,   while   Heinlein\u2019s\ncharacters are more active and disposed towards creating the change themselves.\n\nKaisa Kortekallio, in her article \u201cIntuitive Technologies: Models of Posthuman Subjectivity\nin Simon Ings\u2019 Hot Head  and  Hotwire\u201d focuses on the novels in order to examine how the texts\nappropriate and rewrite the idea of the mind as both material and computational. Kortekallio reads\nIngs\u2019 novels in the context of the theoretical developments within cognitive science, theories of\ncomplex systems, and posthumanism.\n\nIn the third and last article, \u201c\u2018Dragons Are Tricksy\u2019: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s\nLiterature\u201d,   Emily   Midkiff   discusses   the   representation   of   dragons   in   children\u2019s   literature.   She\nsuggests that the figure of the dragon has a lot of uncanny potential to address issues linked to\nhumanity and identity, also in the works aimed for young audiences.\n\nIn addition to the articles, P\u00e4ivi V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen brings us the report of the 35th International\nConference on the Fantastic in the Arts (ICFA) held in Orlando, Florida. V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen praises ICFA for\nits friendly atmosphere and a program as diverse as the field of speculative fiction.\n\nNext issue, Fafnir 3/2014, will be out in September 2014. We are also happy to announce\nthat the fourth issue of  Fafnir  is now open for submissions: research articles, overviews, essays,\nacademic book reviews - you name it!

Looking at the way these works are\ninfluenced by the 1940s pulp science fiction context and Astounding Science Fiction\nmagazine editor John W. Campbell Jr., this article examines their shared sense of\ncontinuous urgency or impending crisis. This leads to authoritarian solutions and a\nrecurrent focus on \u201cGreat Man\u201d characters who manipulate the society toward a\nbetter future with their enlightened awareness of the workings of history. As this\narticle argues, while the stories justify these manipulations by a sense of urgency,\nthey also create tensions where the manipulations become only temporary solutions\nand lead to predetermined futures for all but the power elite.\n\nKeywords: Isaac Asimov, Foundation, Robert A. Heinlein, Golden Age science fiction, future history,\ncrisis, authoritarianism\n\nBiography  and   contact   info:  Jari   K\u00e4kel\u00e4   (MA,   English   Philology)   is   a   doctoral   student   at   the\nUniversity of Helsinki.\n\n\u201c. . . there is nothing in this world so permanent as a temporary emergency.\u201d\nHeinlein, The Past Through Tomorrow, 123\n\nThis article examines the view of history conveyed in the early part of Isaac Asimov\u2019s Foundation\nseries in comparison with \u201cThe Man Who Sold the Moon\u201d (1949) from Robert Heinlein\u2019s Future\nHistory   series.   Both   reflect   also   more   generally   the   spirit   of   the   so-called   \u201cGolden  Age\u201d   of\nAmerican   science   fiction   in   the   1940s,   greatly   influenced   by   editor   John   W.   Campbell   Jr.   of\nAstounding Science Fiction, arguably the most influential pulp SF magazine of the time. Stories by\nboth Asimov and Heinlein frequently involve enlightened engineers who actively shape history and\nbypass democratic processes, and as I argue, in this they repeatedly convey a sense of history as a\nstate of perpetual urgency and crisis where great individuals must rise to the occasion and take\nactive control of the course of events.\n\nWhile   history,   especially   in  Asimov\u2019s   larger   work,   also   connects   with   themes   such   as\nfrontier   and   guardianship,   the   present   article   will   focus   on   the   early   parts   of  Asimov\u2019s   and\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n7\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nManaging and Manipulating History\n\nHeinlein\u2019s series, only briefly pointing out the further and diverging examples of the authors\u2019 other\nconnected works.1\n\nAuthoritarianism is a commonly acknowledged strain in Campbellian science fiction (see\ne.g. Easterbrook, Kilgore, Abbott), frequently seen to be based in social Darwinism and reliance on\nmeritocracy (Smith, Tucker, McGiveron, and Berger). It seems that these ideas are activated and\njustified   through   an   Enlightenment-inspired   necessity   of   contemplating   history   and   societal\ndynamics. But as that contemplation often seems to result in a sense of impending crises, I argue\nthat these stories share an unspoken assumption of a state of urgency which justifies emergency\nmeasures, and as such already postpones any serious consideration of more democratic, and slower,\noptions in building societies and reaching solutions that would lead to the survival of humankind as\na whole.2\n\nAlthough both Asimov\u2019s and Heinlein\u2019s larger story sequences take a consciously historical\napproach, Asimov\u2019s work is based on idealization of a rather somber Enlightenment spirit, while\nHeinlein\u2019s stories are more pluralistic and satirical. Regardless, especially the stories set at the early\nstages of both future histories seem to be rooted in a view of history which requires leadership by\nthe select few at moments of great urgency, even if they also view history as a series of larger\ndevelopments which most individuals cannot affect \u2013 unless they are among the few who possess a\nsuperior understanding of those historical forces.\n\nCampbellian Science Fiction and History\n\nThe future histories of Asimov and Heinlein were both first published as serials in  Astounding\nScience Fiction  magazine during the time when John W. Campbell Jr. had assumed its editorship\nand  was  consciously  seeking  to  raise  the  \u201crespectability\u201d  of  the  genre  by trying  to harness   its\nspeculative   potential   (Chapledaine  et   al.).   In   his   editorials   and   critical   writing   Campbell   also\nemphasized the predictive aspirations of science fiction as a field for thought experiments that were\nhighly relevant to his contemporary society (Campbell, \u201cPlace of SF\u201d 20), fostering a sense of\nliterature   that   addressed   audiences   \u201cwho   felt   they   had   an   immediate   stake   in   the   technosocial\ndisruptions that were remaking a world\u201d (Csicsery-Ronay 81). As Csicsery-Ronay notes, \u201c[d]oing\nso it jettisoned many of the aesthetic and historical axioms of the Western culture\u201d (ibid.), which in\npart led to more conscious attention on the role of  history in the stories, and to the \u201csocial science\nfiction\u201d that considered the impact of science on human culture in general (Asimov, \u201cSocial Science\nFiction\u201d 157\u2013196).\n\nThe characters in these works of Golden Age science fiction use their knowledge of history\nto more effectively manipulate and maneuver the present towards their desired future. This results\nin a very pragmatic and utilitarian conception of history and societal dynamics where history is\nknowledge, and knowledge is power \u2013 bringing about a direct need to learn from the past to build\nthe future. The idea of actively steering the course of the future is apparent also in Campbell\u2019s\neditorials where he claims for SF authors a role in shaping the future. It is a deliberate message of\ntechnological   optimism,   characteristic   of   Campbell\u2019s   desire   to   see   science   fiction   as   a   kind   of\ncontinuation of the Renaissance. Campbell\u2019s introduction to the 1953 Astounding Science Fiction\n\n1      In this article I present a part of the argument in my forthcoming dissertation The Cowboy Politics of an Enlightened Future:\nHistory, Expansionism and Guardianship in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, which will deal with Asimov\u2019s series on the whole, including\nthe interconnected Robot and Foundation stories. Here I focus on Foundation (1951), the first part of the book-form publication of\nthe series which originally appeared in  Astounding  in 1942\u20131950. I have discussed Asimov\u2019s frontier themes also for example in\nK\u00e4kel\u00e4 (2008).\n2       Berger (discussed below) comes close to this crisis-bound idea. Hassler talks about Asimov\u2019s Enlightenment resonances\nmore generally and Miller looks at Asimov\u2019s work as attempts to solve the utilitarian calculation problems of maximizing the\nwell-being of the masses.\n\n8\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 7\u201322\n\nAnthology sums up many of the arguments from his editorials. He views SF as a literature which\ncan help to conceptualize and develop further the early 20th-century \u201cTechnological Revolution\u201d\nbecause it is\n\nthe literature of the technological era. It, unlike other literatures, assumes that change is the\nnatural order of things, that there are goals ahead larger than those we know. That the motto\nof the technical civilization is true: \u201cThere must be a better way of doing this!\u201d (Campbell,\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d xiii)\n\nIn Campbell\u2019s vision, this extends into something that would have an impact on the \u201cmethod of\nliving together; a method of government, a method of thinking, or a method of human relations\u201d\n(ibid.). This is all a staple of the technological optimism that the \u201cnew literature\u201d would address,\nstudying history in order to extrapolate on new ways to build on the past. Campbell\u2019s ideas of the\n\u201cTechnological   Era\u201d   reflect   an   almost   Comtean   positivism   where   knowledge   of   history   has   an\nintegral role in the transition from the Enlightenment, or what Comte called \u201cmetaphysical\u201d stage,\nto the truly scientific, positive stage.\n\nIn   his   promotion   of   science   fiction,   Campbell   sees   the   \u201cold\u201d   literature   in   the   dawning\nTechnological Era as \u201cbitter, confused, disillusioned and angry . . . stories of neurotic, confused and\nessentially homeless-ghost people; people who are trying to live by conventions that have been\nshattered and haven\u2019t been able to build new ones\u201d (xiv). In contrast to this, he posits the \u201cnew\nliterature\u201d of science fiction as more able to effectively take up large themes, and to acknowledge\nand deal with change as a permanent part of human life and the world. It will \u201ctell of goals and\ndirections and solid hope,\u201d providing for a \u201cstability of a compass needle that points always to the\npole it never attains, but knows surely is there\u201d (ibid.). In this rhetoric of optimism and constant\nprogress, Campbell argues for \u201cdynamic stability that lies in going instead of in being\u201d (ibid.).\n\nThe sense of science fiction as first and foremost an ongoing dialogue of ideas has carried to\nthe present for example in the discussions of hard-SF-oriented authors David Brin, Gregory Benford\nand Greg Bear who added to Asimov\u2019s series with their \u201cSecond Foundation Trilogy.\u201d3 They see\nthis as a process where they \u201crevisit\u201d the assumptions of the older works and add to the discussion,\neven if it is, in their view, often misunderstood in criticism as \u201csharecropping\u201d on each other\u2019s ideas\n(Bear 22, 30\u201331). This is what also Csicsery-Ronay refers to with his concept of the SF \u201cmegatext\u201d\nwhich emphasizes the communal aspect of the genre and the \u201cshared subcultural thesaurus\u201d created\nby all of its texts  (Csicsery-Ronay 77n4, 82\u201384). In his view \u201cSF texts are not autonomous; they\ndepend on each other for comparison, dialogue, the grounding and elaboration of ideas\u201d (84). This\nview approaches the works expressly from within the genre and the fandom, and emphasizes the\nrole   of   the   readers\u2019  (and   authors\u2019)   competence   in   the   genre   at   the   same   time   as   it   slightly\nparadoxically praises the universality of the genre\u2019s approach. All in all, the key point here is the\nconsideration of science fiction as thought experiments where new theories are built in dialogue\nwith the old. From the readers\u2019 letter columns in Campbell\u2019s  Astounding  to the present criticism,\nthis   discussion   seeks   to   view   the   thought   experiments   of   science   fiction   as   something   like   a\nsimulation of using the scientific method in actual science.4\n\nIn conjunction with these ideas, Delany places the Campbellian Golden Age in context with\nthe   discoveries   of   Einstein   and   others   who   showed   that   extensive   scientific   revolutions   were\n\n3      Rather than further conceptualize the series, Brin, Benford and Bear update some of Asimov\u2019s ideas with more recent science\nand fill in gaps in the already existing narrative. They do not venture beyond the events in  Foundation and Earth, the novel set in the\nlatest events of Asimov\u2019s fictional world, nor do they consider what the completed collective consciousness of Galaxia would look\nlike.\n4      This emphasis on the ability of science fiction to provide a vehicle for the ideas sometimes leads to seeing more mainstream\nliterary criticism as merely something that gets in the way of the thought experiments, which are often perceived as the genre's most\nimportant aspect. This is apparent already in Campbell\u2019s ideas on the \u201cnew literature,\u201d as he effectively aims for an active and\nintegral role for science fiction in the sphere of societal and political discourse, but not in the sphere or art.\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n9\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nManaging and Manipulating History\n\npossible.  According   to   Delany,   this  \u201ctheoretical   plurality\u201d  inspired   a   critique   of   the   popular\nconception   of   science,  and   the   resulting   constant   \u201cfictive   theoretical   revision\u201d   challenged   what\nmodern science at the time considered impossible (Delany 221). As a result, investigating various\nviews   of   history   became   one   more   thought   experiment,   leading   to   \u201chistorical   plurality\u201d   in\nCampbellian science fiction as it brought history and societal development into the realm of theories\npotentially to be revolutionized by new discoveries (226).\n\nThere are, however, also much more pessimistic interpretations: for example Berger sees the\nworks of Campbellian science fiction to exhibit a world-view centered on desperately opposing the\ndecay implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics which dictates a descent into entropy. In his\nview, much of Campbellian science fiction becomes an (often frustrated) attempt to fight against\nthis impending chaos by recurrently authoritarian methods, and the works do not look as hopeful as\npresented in Campbell\u2019s own rhetoric (Berger 14\u201315).5 Still, at the same time as Berger makes an\nimportant   point   in   criticizing   the   works   of   Campbellian   Golden  Age   for   the   simplification   of\nscientific   and   historical   processes   and   for   the   resulting   authoritarianism,   he   also   rather\nheavy-handedly concludes that \u201cthe ultimate inevitability of entropy made Campbell a determinist\nabout human history\u201d (17). As a result, Berger\u2019s own analysis largely downplays the curious tension\nbetween these gloomy prospects and the \u201cproblem-solving, activism, optimism; hope . . . in the\nright kind of people to master their physical environment,\u201d which Berger sees as mere denial of the\nlosing   battle   (ibid.).  After   all,   even   if   the   solutions   posited   by   Campbellian   SF   are   at   times\nmeritocratic,   authoritarian   and   brutally   utilitarian,   they   still   represent   the   continued   survival   of\nhumankind \u2013 and while they betray distrust in the intelligence of the masses and at times  see\ndemocracy as a hindrance to progress, they nevertheless also exhibit a certain optimism and belief\nin the human ability to come up with new answers in the future.\n\nHeinlein and Asimov both highlight the spirit of the Campbell era, as well as make use of a\nspecific frontier ethos. Heinlein based the outline of his Future History series on the history of\nAmerican expansion and projected the frontier past rather directly onto the near future (see also\nSamuelson 32\u201363), often exaggerating certain aspects of the American frontier mythos (and ethos)\nto satirical proportions. His future history outline progresses from \u201cThe Crazy Years\u201d of the 1940s\nEuropean collapse and \u201cconsiderable technical advance\u201d in the US to space exploration consciously\nmodelled   on   American   frontier   expansion   in   \u201copening   of   new   frontiers   and   a   return   to\nnineteenth-century   economy\u201d   (The   Past   Through   Tomorrow  660\u2013661).   This   then   turns   into\n\u201cImperial Exploitation\u201d and develops through \u201crevolutions,\u201d \u201cextreme puritanism,\u201d and \u201creligious\ndictatorship\u201d into the \u201c[r]e-establishment of civil liberty\u201d and \u201c[r]enascence of scientific research\u201d\nwhich enables yet another move toward the stars (ibid.). Populating this timeline with stories that\nare only loosely connected, Heinlein created a fairly pluralist mosaic view of the future history of\nhuman advance into space.\n\nIn contrast, Asimov\u2019s series offered a view of encompassing sweeps of future history which\nunfolded as a unified story, and transmitted a sense of a mythical grand narrative of all humanity,\nemploying an encyclopedic flavor akin to Edward Gibbon\u2019s The History of the Decline and Fall of\nthe Roman Empire  (1776\u20131789) which was the initial inspiration behind the desire to write, as\nAsimov himself describes it, \u201ca science fiction story that  read  like a historical novel\u201d (I, Asimov\n116\u2013117, original emphasis). This historical approach opened vast conceptual possibilities, and also\nturned from the analogies of Roman history into analogies of the American history of expansionism\nand theorizations on the significance of the frontier in the American development, as I have argued\nelsewhere (\u201cAsimov\u2019s Foundation\u201d).\n\n5     Berger criticizes Campbellian SF as \u201cincreasingly misanthropic and elitist\u201d with a deeply rooted distrust in the human faculty\nwhich leads to authoritarianism because \u201cthe masses cannot be trusted to govern themselves\u201d (32). This leads to \u201cthe forceful\noppression of certain kinds of change, at least for all but an elite.\u201d Berger sees this as a frustration arising from the attempt to reduce\nproblems to their essentials in the spirit of the scientific method, when history or society cannot be so reduced (31).\n\n10\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 7\u201322\n\nHeinlein\u2019s stories concentrate on individuals and local concerns, and connect to his own\npresent through detailed references to American frontier history, as well as satirical exaggerations of\nlaissez-faire capitalism (Tucker 189\u2013190) and political manipulation. Although Asimov\u2019s work, too,\nincludes  political manipulation and plutocratic plotting, in his series  they are represented more\nsimply as societal trends, and the stories are inhabited by characters who take an active role as they\nnot only try to understand the past but also seek to transform that understanding into action. Despite\nthe fact that Asimov\u2019s series focuses on mostly one character per story, it manages to create a feel of\na panoramic view of the history of a society as it changes. While Heinlein focuses on individual\ncharacters at crucial points in his future history, Asimov\u2019s work builds a grand narrative that covers\nthe future history of the whole of the human species.\n\nAs   I   discuss   in   the   following,   the   conceptions   of   history   in   the   works   of  Asimov   and\nHeinlein become apparent through the motifs of urgency and the \u201cGreat Men\u201d of history who rise to\nthe task of managing that situation, and succeed through their ability to view history in a way that\nenables them to base their manipulations on it.\n\nWorlds of Perpetual Urgency and Determinism for the Masses\n\nMany of the Golden Age writers were infatuated with the idea of the Enlightenment and presented\nstreamlined versions of it in their stories under Campbell\u2019s editorship, reflecting his positivism and\nfaith in the power of science and technology. However, this faith is often shadowed by cynicism in\nterms of politics and the importance of individual rights, veering in its ideals toward enlightened\ndespotism. The early 20th-century context was one of the sources for the desire in American SF,\ninspired by the new scientific discoveries, to fight against the seemingly impending chaos brought\nabout by the social upheavals, depression, war and fascism of the 1930s (Berger 14\u201315). In this,\nmuch of the Campbellian science optimism can be seen as attempts to navigate through the societal\nentropy   and   to   maintain   a   precarious   balance   on   the   brink   of   chaos.   Even   as  Asimov\u2019s   series\nprogresses rather optimistically from one crisis to another, it also exhibits a nervous urgency of\nfighting off that impending chaos6 (in a very concrete manner as psychohistory is trying to shorten\nthe coming \u201cDark Age\u201d of the galaxy), and a certain awareness that things can very easily slip into\nthis  nearly irredeemable state. All of this  creates the need for authoritarian control, which will\nenable the corrective  action. All in all, Asimov and Heinlein both explore various aspects of the\nmotif of conspiracy or elite control (Clareson 30, Abbott 108, Palumbo 49\u201364), justified by the\nurgency of the historical situation.\n\nIn the Foundation series the character of Hari Seldon becomes a purveyor of the perpetual\nurgency   under   which   the   Foundationers   constantly   work.   In   his   recorded   appearance   at   the\nFoundation   \u201cTime  Vault\u201d   fifty   years   after   its   establishment   in   exile   from   the   Galactic   Empire,\nSeldon sets the stage for the crises to come:\n\nFrom now on, and into the centuries, the path you must take is inevitable. You will be faced\nwith a series of crises. . . .\n\nBut whatever devious course your future history may take, impress it always upon\nyour descendants that the path has been marked out, and that at its end is [a] new and greater\nEmpire! (Foundation 80\u201381)\n\nSeldon\u2019s message casts the Foundationers as \u201cthe seeds of Renascence and the future founders of\nthe Second Galactic Empire\u201d (ibid.) whose destiny it is to save the whole of human civilization. As\n\n6     Palumbo (2002) focuses on the idea of chaos and fractal symmetry as self-similarity in Asimov\u2019s plot structure. On this basis he\nconducts an insightful, but still rather conventional reading of the recurring themes in the series, ordered according to his findings on\nthe plot structure.\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n11\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nManaging and Manipulating History\n\nSeldon repeatedly engages in these crisis-bound conceptualizations of history and future, for the\nFoundationers his recorded appearances make him a godlike entity behind their national destiny.\nThe Foundationers are thus immersed in ideas of an urgent duty to expand and redeem the rest of\nthe galaxy, and this will become the ultimate justification for manipulations when the characters of\nthe politician Salvor Hardin and businessman Hober Mallow rise to the challenge. When they do,\nthey are frequently portrayed as the only ones who realize the state of urgency and see the larger\npatterns of history.\n\nWhile Asimov\u2019s heroes assume power at states of emergency, Heinlein\u2019s heroes remain more\nambivalent. Still, also Heinlein\u2019s very openly manipulative protagonist, D.D. Harriman in \u201cThe\nMan Who Sold the Moon,\u201d argues that he needs to be in control of the moon flights because only he\ncan be the moral guardian of the possibilities that they produce:\n\nHandled right, it can mean a new and braver world. Handle it wrong and it\u2019s a one-way\nticket  to Armageddon.  . .  . I  plan to  be  the  Man  in the  Moon myself\u2013\u2013and  give it my\npersonal attention to see that it\u2019s handled right. (Heinlein 146)\n\nBoth Asimov\u2019s and Heinlein\u2019s characters repeatedly assume a position of guardianship over society\nas they take responsibility and guide all of humanity despite their personal interests. As Harriman\nputs it early on in Heinlein\u2019s story: \u201cthere is nothing in this world so permanent as a temporary\nemergency\u201d (123). It is this urgency that calls for the \u201cGreat Men\u201d of history to step up, and the\nnarratives of both Asimov and Heinlein build on a conception of history which focuses on these\nfigures.\n\nIn this, the masses are often left in the background. The fact that \u201cthe path has been marked\nout\u201d   raises   the   discussion   of   determinism   in  Asimov\u2019s   series.   While   for   example   Elkins   sees\nAsimov\u2019s   psychohistory   as   essentially   distorting   ideas   of   historical   materialism   to   a   cyclical\nconception of history (96\u2013110), Freedman more recently views psychohistory as reducing Marxism\nand   Freudian   psychoanalysis   to   nineteenth-century   positivism   which   assumes   the   masses   to   be\ncompletely passive. This leads to \u201cinvesting of all meaningful agency in an elite and aloof clerisy\u201d\n(Freedman, \u201cRemembering the Future\u201d 133\u2013134). Indeed, Asimov\u2019s \u201cnecessary assumption[s]\u201d of\npsychohistory do demand this, as the human reaction stimuli must be kept constant for the whole\ntheory   to   work   (Foundation  20).   On   the   other   hand,   the   problems   of   this   reduction   are\nacknowledged already in Asimov\u2019s series as it continues: as human history cannot be simplified in\nsuch a mechanistic way, this sends Asimov on an infinite course of trying to patch up the problems\ncreated by his previous solutions. Along these lines, Delany has noted that the series in fact comes\nclose to the spirit of the scientific method when it seeks to address these problems in later stories,\nthus engaging in a dialogue with ideas presented in the earlier stories (see Delany 223-227). In his\nview,   the   latter   half   of  Asimov\u2019s   original   trilogy   \u2013   the   stories   with   the   Seldon-Plan-disrupting\ncharacter of \u201cMule,\u201d and the scientific community of the Second Foundation who try to fix the Plan\nafter him \u2013 questions this determinism and positivism, in effect delivering a two-part message that\n\u201chistory is intellectually negotiable but not deterministically predictable\u201d (Delany 223\u2013225).\n\nHowever, it seems to me that all of this overlooks the point that history in Asimov\u2019s series is\nnever   really   deterministic   in   the   first   place.   Psychohistory   is   a   statistical   tool   that   will   reveal\ntendencies and probable developments, but that information is always used by someone to initiate\nsome action. These initiating agents \u2013 nearly always a power elite, comprised of however few\npeople   \u2013   retain   their   freedom   of   action   and   the   direction   chosen   becomes   a   matter   of   their\nreasoning. Their actions may effectively result in determinism for the masses, but in this curious\nmixture of looking at the masses through the power elite, the masses fade into the background. In\npsychohistory, the social sciences are extrapolated into the realm of hard sciences, and history itself\nbecomes a set of data that can be treated through the methods of the natural sciences. Therefore, it\n\n12\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 7\u201322\n\nbecomes a utilitarian method of taking guardianship over the human future history, to minimize\nstrife and to try to provide the greatest good for the greatest number of people (see also Miller\n189\u2013206). As Asimov\u2019s fictional world is ultimately dictated by rationality, there seems to be no\neffective need for a discussion on the morality of this guarding elite \u2013 their benevolence is as if\nautomated   by   their   reliance   on   science   and   reason.   Furthermore,   this   same   power   structure   is\npresent   in  Asimov\u2019s   series   even   in   the   stories   where   the   current   power   elite   operate   without\nknowledge of psychohistory. Even there similar layers of hidden elite control are present, and rather\nthan positing that there is no way to affect the course of the future, this possibility can be accessed\nonly by the very few of a highly select elite, and even they have to struggle to succeed.\n\nThus these works exhibit a tension between the two conceptualizations of history which\nShippey sees in much of science fiction: the \u201cMalthusian\u201d idea that society is bound by technical\nand   economic   forces   invisible   to   the   individual,   and   the   \u201cmythopoeic,   hero-making\u201d   idea   that\nhistory progresses purposefully and with definite agency by individuals toward the present which is\nsuperior to the past (Shippey 6\u20138). While this develops into a more pluralistic view as the narratives\nof Asimov and Heinlein progress,  Foundation  implicitly and \u201cMan Who Sold The Moon\u201d more\nobviously emphasize individual actors who are able to take advantage of the Malthusian forces of\nsociety with their own rational ability.7\n\nFreedom and Responsibility of the Great Men\n\nEspecially the early part of the Foundation series becomes a sort of a hagiography of the frontier\nfilibuster,   robber   baron   and   merchant   prince   characters   who   begin   building   the   nation   on   the\nfrontier. In Asimov\u2019s series, the actions of such characters are easily justified through the urgency\nset by Hari Seldon\u2019s speech, and even though they do not possess the same knowledge of the future\nto come as Seldon, they earn their place among the heroes of Foundation history. Their impetus\nseems to be Thomas Carlyle\u2019s \u201cGreat Man Theory\u201d according to which  \u201cthe history of what man\nhas accomplished in this world, is at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here\u201d\n(Carlyle 4). This idea was popularized  in Carlyle\u2019s  On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in\nHistory (1840), and it becomes one of the leading conceptions of history behind Asimov\u2019s series,\nand the same is apparent also in several of Heinlein\u2019s works. In fact, a couple of minor characters in\n\u201cThe Man Who Sold the Moon\u201d even refer to Carlyle explicitly.\n\nIn addition to this, the pulp context of Asimov and Heinlein brings in the idea of heroic\nindividuals who shape the course of history in a way that resonates with the convention of the\n\u201cuniversal hero,\u201d as analyzed by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949). The\nthree stages of what he calls a monomyth are \u201ca separation from the world, a penetration to some\nsource of power, and a life-enhancing return\u201d (35). Just as there is a universal mythic structure of\nquest in the specifically American cultural myths of \u201csettling the West\u201d and \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d\n(Mackey-Kallis   17),   the   Great   Man   heroes   of  Asimov   and   Heinlein   become   the   realizers   of   a\nmythical quest as they transform not themselves but the world around them through the escape \u2013\ninitiation \u2013 return formula.\n\nIn the Foundation series, Hari Seldon is the ultimate Great Man figure as the developer of\npsychohistory.   The   chapter   \u201cThe   Psychohistorians\u201d   in  Foundation,   opening   the   book-form\npublication of the series, adds to building the myth as it shows Seldon prophetically mapping out\n\n7      The two larger series also contain stories like Heinlein\u2019s \u201cLogic of Empire\u201d and Asimov\u2019s \u201cThe General\u201d in  Foundation and\nEmpire (originally published as \u201cDead Hand\u201d in May 1945 Astounding) which demonstrate the helplessness of the individual in the\ngrip of the historical forces. This is in contrast with the maneuverings of the traders and mayors in the early parts of Asimov\u2019s series\nwhere the characters do steer the society, but much in the way of Heinlein\u2019s heroes do not attempt to go against the flow of history\nand societal developments. Instead, they harness these forces for their personal advantage at the same time as they work for the\ncommon good.\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n13\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nManaging and Manipulating History\n\nthe course of the First Galactic Empire\u2019s decline with the certainty of a man with a vision and plans\ncalculated   by   the   scientific   accuracy   of   \u201cthe   developed   mathematics   of   over   eighteen   years\u201d\n(Foundation  27). When Seldon is taken to a trial where he has to answer accusations of rousing\nrebellion against the Empire with his predictions, he is \u201cunperturbed. . . . the only spot of stability\nremaining in the world\u201d (28). He is the purveyor of \u201cscientific truth [which] is beyond loyalty and\ndisloyalty\u201d   (29)   and   not   a   puppet   of   the   crumbling   empire   that   challenges   him.   Through\npsychohistory Seldon is more \u201caware of both the present status and the past history of the Empire\u201d\n(33) than anyone else, and at the same time he becomes a founding father figure and a Great Man of\nhistorical importance to all Foundationers.\n\nHowever,   while   Seldon\u2019s   messages   may   inspire   the   masses   by   casting   them   as   the\nprotagonists of a magnificent future, they provide no actual guidance. Rather, they enforce a split\nbetween those few who understand and control the science and the many who to whom it becomes a\nmatter of predestination, as discussed above. Only a select few, protagonists like Salvor Hardin and\nHober Mallow, are able to use their intellect to distance themselves from what seems pure magic\nand predestination to others, in order to go beyond the shock and awe of the sublime vision and start\nactively   forwarding   the   Foundation\u2019s   expansionist   mission.   Repeatedly   in  Asimov\u2019s   series,   the\nGreat Men are found among those who are not mesmerized by the seemingly sublime scope of\nhistory laid before them, but are instead able to place it in the world of reason and take action (see\nK\u00e4kel\u00e4, \u201cEnlightened Sense of Wonder?\u201d).\n\nSimilar noble aspirations can be found in Heinlein\u2019s characters as well, but equally strong is\nthe sense of the capable individual\u2019s right to take also personal advantage of the situation. Smith\n(137\u2013171) and Tucker (172\u2013193) among others have discussed the social Darwinism apparent in\nmany of Heinlein\u2019s works, and it seems evident that while Heinlein\u2019s stories provide an optimistic\nview   of   the   possibility   of   human   development,   they   also   open   the   door   to   meritocracy   and\njustification of authoritarian control by the \u201cfittest\u201d   (Cf. McGiveron 53\u2013548). The adoration for\nMachiavellian heroes who become significant historical figures through their courage to act upon\ntheir vision is clearly present in the character of Harriman. At first he seems like a purely capitalist\nrobber baron on \u201cthe greatest real estate venture since the Pope carved up the New World,\u201d ready to\nstrike a deal that is \u201clike having Manhattan Island offered to you for twenty-four dollars and a case\nof whiskey\u201d (Heinlein 132), and operating with a savoir-faire where \u201cthe use of bribe money is a\nhomeopathic art\u201d (140). Initially Harriman is the fabled American entrepreneur-turned-tycoon with\na \u201cMidas touch\u201d (134) who makes use of the virgin land rhetoric and frontier parallels only to\nfurther his business interests. However, as he reveals his larger nation-building vision in direct\ncomparisons between the history of American independence and the notion of establishing a free\nstate on the Moon, his plan is shown to be more than a mere plutocratic daydream. Thus Harriman\nbecomes the lone hero who understands the situation and now his greater goal justifies all of his\nmanipulations:\n\nThe   Moon   was   not   meant   to   be   owned   by   a   single   country,   even   the   United   States.\n(145\u2013146)\n\nI\u2019m   going   to   see   this   thing   developed,   not   milked.

The race is about as prepared for it as an innocent virgin is prepared\nfor sex. Unless the whole matter isn\u2019t handled carefully, it will be bitched up. (203)\n\n8     McGiveron contests that Heinlein\u2019s Social Darwinism is \u201cnot a celebration of mindless expansionism, but, consistently, a call to\narms to those who would remain free; he espouses justifiable defense rather than rapacious offense.\u201d In his view, Heinlein\u2019s \u201cidealism\nand pragmatism temper each other\u201d and produce solutions of mutually tolerated existence instead of purely socially Darwinistic\n\u201cmindless predatory organisms\u201d (54). All in all, McGiveron gives Heinlein much more of a benefit of doubt than the numerous\ncritics\u2019 allegations of elitist libertarianism bordering on fascism.\n\n14\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 7\u201322\n\nHarriman himself is somehow the only one who is not as innocent: as a self-appointed guardian, he\nwill   ease   the   virgin   humanity   safely   into   this   adulthood   that   it   will   find   in   transforming   the\nuntouched land of the space frontier into an established society. In his vision and conviction that he\nmust nurture humanity in the right direction, Harriman is rather like Asimov\u2019s heroes.\n\nthat\n\n  Harriman\u2019s   business   partners   debate   his   status   as\n\nAs   Heinlein\u2019s   story   is   filled   with   conscious   and   direct   contemplation   on   the   historical\nanalogies,\n  frontier\nentrepreneur-cum-Carlylean hero. Comparing him to \u201cthe last of the Robber Barons [who] opened\nup the American West,\u201d they see him as \u201cthe first of the new Robber Barons\u201d and make a conscious\nreference to Carlyle and \u201cthe \u2018Hero\u2019 theory\u201d (185). These minor characters function to highlight\nconsiderations of the historical significance of both the situation of opening the space frontier and\nthe role of individual Great Men in it. Still, because Harriman\u2019s business partners are themselves\nnot adept enough to become the historically significant rulers of Carlyle\u2019s hero theory, they stay on\nthe \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d set in motion by Harriman\u2019s manipulations and rather easily get past their\nconcerns of him \u201csetting up new imperialism\u201d (186). Even this much concern for the side-effects of\nmanipulation is something of an exception in these stories, as they frequently idolize the robber\nbaron figures as the new Western entrepreneurs. The ethos of the stories is that even if the scheming\nis devious as such, the characters turn into heroes when they contribute to the development of the\nfrontier nation.\n\nHarriman operates in a knowable present with all the possible resources of information and\nwealth at his disposal, but the Foundation mayor Salvor Hardin has to rely entirely on his own\nrational ability. His story is set in a moment of utmost urgency as the Foundation\u2019s existence is\nthreatened   by   the   surrounding   kingdoms,  and   in   this   situation   Hardin   becomes   the   first  of   the\nFoundation Great Men to begin establishing it as a nation of its own. Hardin is empowered by his\nown ability and vision as he starts working toward Seldon\u2019s goal by piecing together information\nabout psychohistory and Seldon\u2019s objectives. While the Foundation Encyclopedists passively wait\nfor a \u201cdeus ex machina\u201d (Foundation 73) of the Old Empire or Seldon\u2019s calculations to resolve their\nproblems, in the spirit of Enlightenment, Hardin takes an active role, realizing that \u201cwe must work it\nout ourselves\u201d (75). At this point he seems to be the only one with at least a suspicion that there\nmay be a greater whole towards which they should be heading. With his sense of self-reliance, he is\nable to reproach the Foundation scientists for passively only relying on \u201cauthority or the past \u2013\nnever on [them]selves\u201d (74). Hardin\u2019s pragmatic self-reliance simply brushes aside any paralyzing\nawe that his own vague knowledge of Seldon\u2019s plan may evoke, and he gets to work.\n\nThe relatively static nature of Asimov\u2019s characters in the  Foundation  series produces this\ncontradiction: as they correspond at least metaphorically with Joseph Campbell's monomyth, they\ngo through motions which should cause some change. However, as they are the Great Men who\npossess a strong sense of mission to begin with, they need no transformations like the reluctant\nacceptance   of  responsibility,   which   would   be  typical   for   pulp   heroes. As   often   in Asimov,   the\ncharacters whose actions change the world remain themselves representations of the societal forces,\nrather than show any individual development \u2013 even if, paradoxically, individualism is one of the\nforces that they represent.9\n\nIn his analysis on the body of Heinlein\u2019s work as \u201cincessant focus on the single individual\nand his world\u201d (99), Slusser points out a factor which seems the key to the difference between\nHeinlein and Asimov. Heinlein\u2019s focus on individuals can be seen to rise from a different concern:\nwhile Asimov uses individual heroes  as emblems of forces that move the society onwards and\ncreate the future history, with Heinlein the actual individual and his preservation are much more\nsignificant.   As   Slusser   points   out,   Heinlein\u2019s   work   exhibits   a   \u201cpreoccupation   with   endlessly\n\n9      Later on, Asimov\u2019s series does feature also characters whose inherent sense of mission works to show the futility of individual\naction, as in the case of Lathan Devers in Foundation and Empire.\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n15\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nManaging and Manipulating History\n\nextending the material line of a single existence\u201d (108n), as in his Lazarus Long stories. Although\nAsimov\u2019s   future  history  is  often  criticized  for  the  stylized  and  interchangeable  characters,  it  is\nprecisely   this   emblematic   nature   of   the   characters   which   contributes   to   creating   the   sweeping\nnarration of the large historical movements and societal dynamics. To add to this, Asimov\u2019s heroes\nare   distinguished   from   Heinlein\u2019s   by   the   way   they   more   easily   accept   the   limitations   of   their\npersonal existence, and also step down from the seat of power.10\n\nWith both Asimov and Heinlein, however, the actual justification for why these specific\nindividuals should be in control does not seem to be much more than the fact that they happen to\nrise to the challenge, and be responsible enough to see to it that in addition to accumulating their\nown wealth, they benefit society (or the \u2018right side\u2019 of it anyway) as a whole. As De Witt Douglas\nKilgore notes in Astrofuturism: \u201c[i]n Heinlein\u2019s narratives, the right to control new lands and wealth\nis conferred according to one\u2019s standing in a meritocratic hierarchy\u201d (95; see also Elkins 105). The\nsame is true of Asimov\u2019s characters whose actions are justified by their awareness of the workings\nof history,  and their  ability  to take  advantage of them.  This  position  is  authorized through  the\nlanguage   of   Puritan   election   (Slusser   96\u201398;   Kilgore   94)   even   if   it   is   election   by   capitalistic\nprowess, not divine election or salvation. Hence, also Heinlein\u2019s Harriman becomes the lone hero\nwho   directs   humanity.   In   the   words   of   Kilgore:   \u201c[t]he   wonderful   dream   of   new   frontiers   and\nAmerican renewal . . . is authoritarian even as it professes a rhetoric of egalitarian individualism\u201d\n(95).   This   tension   between   individual   freedom   and   authoritarianism   and   between   self-serving\nexploitation and enlightened guardianship is ever present in Asimov and Heinlein.\n\nHistorical Awareness and Manipulation\n\nOne of the central faculties of Asimov\u2019s and Heinlein\u2019s Great Men seems to be this ability to turn\nthe understanding of their historical context into practical action (see also Berger 19). As noted\nabove, this consciousness of history leads to deliberately applying frontier imagery as a means of\nrejuvenating the culture. This comes across as the necessity of expansion to retain cultural vitality,\nand links it with Frederick Jackson Turner\u2019s \u201cFrontier Thesis\u201d in Asimov\u2019s case (K\u00e4kel\u00e4, \u201cAsimov\u2019s\nFoundation\u201d), while in Heinlein\u2019s \u201cThe Man Who Sold the Moon\u201d it appears as a promotion of\nspace travel in a readily familiar package with easily exploitable connotations of national mission\nand virility.11\n\nAsimov\u2019s   Hardin   becomes   a   Great   Man   through   his   ability   to   self-reliantly   deduce   the\nFoundation\u2019s point in history and to take advantage of it, but also through his more general ability to\nform a comprehensive view of the Galaxy\u2019s history. Passages that merge Hardin\u2019s voice with the\nnarrator\u2019s provide glimpses of historical movement reminiscent of history textbook rhetoric:\n\nAnd now that the Empire had lost control over the farther reaches of the Galaxy, these little\nsplinter groups of planets became kingdoms \u2013 with comic-opera kings and nobles, and petty,\nmeaningless wars, and a life that went on pathetically among the ruins. (Foundation 86)\n\nHardin\u2019s   thoughts   combine   here   with  the   narrator\u2019s   voice   to   give   an  encompassing   account   of\nhistory. This description of the declining Galactic Empire has evident affinities to Gibbon\u2019s Decline\nand Fall, and as Hardin\u2019s character is here given an omniscient perspective, he is set clearly above\nthe details of individual historical events. The Foundation leaders are on a mission that is much\n\n10     An exception of sorts is the robot character R. Daneel who first appears in Asimov\u2019s 1950s novels  The Caves of Steel and The\nNaked Sun, and is brought back in his 1980s additions to the series as a godlike entity with his 20 000 years of existence and\nguardianship over the galactic history. Being an Asimovian robot, he will never consider himself more important than the humanity\nwhich he guards, but he is also a representation of the ultimate ability: a self-evolved guardian of all humanity.\n11     Frontier as a safety valve in Turnerian terms has been seen also in Heinlein\u2019s work (Tucker 178).\n\n16\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 7\u201322\n\nmore far-reaching, and for them history is more of a scientific problem which they observe and\nsteer from afar on their way towards Seldon\u2019s promised land of the Second Galactic Empire. Hence,\nHardin always seems to be something of an outside observer of the history unfolding before him,\neven when he steers its events himself.\n\nHeinlein\u2019s Harriman, on the other hand, is in the thick of things as he is constantly arguing\nfor   space   frontier   expansion   that   mirrors   the   American   expansion,   and   his   success   lies   in\nmaneuvering his way around the obstacles set up by government. The story gets much of its drive\nfrom following Harriman\u2019s increasingly more imaginative manipulations as he sets up his venture\nby bribing, lying and bending the letter of law. Key to all of this, however, is the portrayal of\nHarriman   as   a   character   so   aware   of   history   that   he   consciously   repeats   the   frontier   myth   of\nAmerican history on the Moon. In a sense, the novum of the story is Harriman\u2019s ability to reiterate\nthe  American   frontier   myth   as   a   marketing   tool   for   space   exploration,   but   also   to   implement\nunrestricted power capitalism in its realization.\n\nAsimov\u2019s characters are rather serious compared to Heinlein\u2019s merry pack of new frontier\nrobber   barons,   perhaps   with   the   exception   of   Hober   Mallow   in   the  Foundation  chapter   \u201cThe\nMerchant Princes.\u201d He embodies the same historical vision and awareness as Salvor Hardin, and his\nability for management and manipulation are central in the latter half of the novel. After the first\nsteps in frontier survival represented by Hardin, the Foundation turns to more active conquering\nthrough commerce. Mallow is a purely capitalist businessman with no pretensions (\u201cMoney is my\nreligion\u201d Foundation 184), and a readiness to guide a potential customer through \u201cthe workings of\ndummy corporations\u201d (187) to seal a deal. Still, he becomes another Great Man in Foundation\nhistory by retaining his position as a \u201cfree agent\u201d (210) and a lone hero, \u201cthe only man who knows\nhow to fight the crisis\u201d (222) \u2013 thus legitimizing the use of any means necessary. Indeed, Mallow\u2019s\nrobber baron heroism is in its ambivalence close to Heinlein\u2019s Harriman: he is ultimately doing\nwhat advances the greater cause of the Foundation, but he is also the one to make the biggest profit\non the maneuverings that lead to it.\n\nEven though the Foundation mayor\u2019s secretary, who becomes Mallow\u2019s adversary, criticizes\nthe provincial-origin Mallow for not having the \u201csense of destiny\u201d (232) of the Foundationers, by\nthe end of the story it is clear that Mallow is the one with a greater and an active sense of the\nhistorical forces at play. He is able to turn the situation to the Foundation\u2019s favor through his vision\nwhich   is   much  more   than  just   a  passive  sense  of  destiny.   However,   in  this  case   taking   action\nironically means doing nothing but letting the current crisis run its course, as will happen when the\nFoundation makes no offensive against the kingdom of Korell that threatens them with war. By his\nhistorical understanding, Mallow is able to understand what will happen when the Foundation cuts\nthe trading connections with them:\n\nThe whole war is a battle between . . . The [old] Empire [which supports Korell] and the\nFoundation. . . . To seize control of a world, they bribe with immense ships that can make\nwar, but lack economic significance. We, on the other hand, bribe with little things, useless\nin war, but vital to prosperity and profits. (231)\n\nKnowing that \u201cpeople endure a good deal in war,\u201d Mallow aims for a stalemate during which,\ninstead   of   wartime   \u201cpatriotic   uplift   of   imminent   danger,\u201d   the   Korellians   will   be   met   by\naccumulating everyday annoyances as the Foundation-sold technology will begin to fail, and the\npublic dissatisfaction will lead to their eventual surrender (229).\n\nBy this capacity for encompassing vistas of social movement, much like those of Hardin\u2019s,\nMallow solves the crisis, and this is the redeeming factor of all his brutal economic manipulation\nwhich in itself does not make him look like much of a hero. Paradoxically, but typically for the\nseries, even though Mallow too knows that \u201cSeldon crises are not solved by individuals but by\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n17\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nManaging and Manipulating History\n\nhistoric forces,\u201d his manipulations to gain power so that he can make sure that historical forces are\nleft to carry out their course, amount exactly to those \u201cbrilliant heroics\u201d (228). The fact that in the\nlarger scheme of things Mallow (just like Hardin) is very consciously working for the greater cause,\ngives a Campbellian moral justification to all the admiration of clever manipulation in the first part\nof the Foundation trilogy.\n\nThis exhibits the typically American active pragmatism and optimism in Campbellian SF\nwhich solves the problems and masters the environment once \u201cthe right kind of people\u201d are given\nfreedom to work, but it also betrays the view that someone needs to take over the masses for the\nsake of their own well-being (Berger 16\u201317). The theme of elite control develops as the general\npublic is repeatedly shown to be, as Berger notes, \u201cill-informed, prejudiced, and more than willing\nto follow the manipulative leadership of nearly anyone egotistical enough and sufficiently skilled to\nstep out in front of the crowd\u201d (20). As these works often take this social dynamic as a given,\nauthoritarianism becomes also the moral answer: if the masses blindly follow authority in any case,\nit would be irresponsible to let the less capable assume the authority (see also Easterbrook 53).\nRecurrently this  amounts  to a willing surrender to the idea that you cannot change the society\nagainst the flow of history and be personally successful, but you can maneuver your way through it\nand accumulate personal success.\n\nThe parts of Asimov\u2019s and Heinlein\u2019s series discussed here focus on the power elites as they\nmaneuver the society through its first steps in frontier survival and set up expansionism. However,\nboth series do feature also characters that are not part of the elite, at least not to begin with. For\nexample in Asimov\u2019s \u201cSearch by the Foundation\u201d in  Second Foundation  (originally published in\nDecember 1949 and January 1950 Astounding under the title \u201c\u2013And Now You Don\u2019t\u201d) the teenage\nprotagonist Arkady Darell helps to defeat the hidden power elite of the Second Foundation, even if\nthe story ends with a revelation that the First Foundation\u2019s seeming victory is only bluff designed to\nlet   the   Second   Foundation   continue   its   hidden   control.   Heinlein\u2019s   Future   History   also   features\ncharacters like the na\u00efve would-be frontier hero in the story \u201cCoventry,\u201d or the unfortunate lawyer\nin \u201cLogic of Empire\u201d who ends up on the oppressed side of the expansionistic society. At first these\nstories do in fact seem somewhat critical of the division created by the authoritarian urgency of\nfrontier management. However, the criticism is brushed aside as the protagonist of \u201cCoventry\u201d\nreaches a meritocratic redemption of sorts when he accepts responsibility and aspires to become a\npart of the power elite; and when the lawyer in \u201cLogic of Empire tries to turn attention to the\nhorrors of the slavery that he managed to escape and is treated as a fool for refusing to see that\nslavery just happens to be a \u201cnecessary\u201d part of building an empire. Also in those Heinlein\u2019s Future\nHistory stories which focus on smaller-scale incidents, the society is built along authoritarian and\nmeritocratic lines and the difficulty of emerging from the underside of society is an important part\nof validating the individual\u2019s ability. This is evident for example in \u201cMisfit\u201d where an awkward and\nuneducated working class protagonist turns out to be a mathematical genius who saves the day on a\nmilitary-run   construction   site   of   the   space   expansion.   Even   here   it   is   the   individual\u2019s   own\nextraordinary ability that distinguishes him from the masses and grants potential access to the elite.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn his  editorials  for  Astounding  Campbell very  consciously gives  science fiction  an active and\nintegral role in affecting societal development. He echoes Auguste Comte\u2019s aphorism that \u201cfrom\nscience comes prediction; from prediction comes action\u201d (quoted in Pickering 566) and stresses the\nimportance of science fiction in anticipating the goals towards which humanity should strive. This\ncan be seen as a central idea behind many of the Golden Age works. Neither Campbell, Heinlein\n\n18\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 7\u201322\n\nnor Asimov is interested in history for the sake of knowing the past but for actively learning from it\nand contemplating possible future directions.\n\nIn these works, science and the understanding of history are combined into what is viewed\nas the best available way to scramble from one solution, which may well be the source of the next\nproblem, on to the next. Berger sees in this the frustration of Campbellian SF authors when they\n\u201ccannot deliver on their promises of utopia\u201d (29). However, instead of grandiose visions of utopia,\nthe works seem to exhibit faith in the power of science to come up with at least temporary solutions\nthat are good enough for the time being, and faith in scientific advance to produce also new ones as\nthey are needed. Even if it at times seems like a desperate process, it is presented as a well-meaning\nattempt to save or steer the world. Furthermore, I would contest that while a certain desire for\nutopia12 exists in the background, rather than frustrated, it is moderated by pragmatism about what\ncan really be done. This  utopian desire is linked with the conviction that human history needs\nsomeone enlightened but strong enough to take the wheel because there is no time to arrive at the\nsame results by democratic processes.\n\nAlthough the leadership by Great Men in both authors\u2019 works is supposedly a temporary\nstate   on   the   way   towards   a   new   stability,   as   the   pattern   of   crisis   management   by   any   means\nnecessary is repeated, it illustrates the view of history as a perpetual urgency where the ideals of\ndemocracy are indefinitely put on hold. As the frontier society of Asimov\u2019s Foundation is built and\nmanaged through the crises and toward the new Galactic Empire, the characters seek justification in\nthe greater good for all humanity. Heinlein\u2019s representation, on the other hand, is more ambivalent\nand provides more of a satirical commentary on his contemporary world that extends into future by\nrepeating the patterns of past events. Heinlein is at times uneasily walking the line between satire\nand libertarian jingoism, and much more than in Asimov, in his work the sense of urgency is created\nthrough one character\u2019s vision of what is good for all humanity \u2013 often indistinguishable from their\nprofit-seeking actions in a caricatured world of  laissez-faire  market economy. Nevertheless, also\nthere the ability to understand and make use of history at a moment of urgency becomes a key\ncomponent of the story.\n\nEspecially   in   Asimov\u2019s  Foundation  series,   the   idea   of   enlightened   engineers   leads   to\ncontradictions at every turn. His grand narrative of humanity in the future results in tension between\nseveral elements, complicating the all-encompassing vista which it seeks to build. This is repeatedly\nseen through dichotomies that exist between the concept of history that Asimov\u2019s works seem to\nimply, and the Enlightenment idea of progress. Finally, Asimov\u2019s work points toward a tension\nbetween the Enlightenment freedom and the increasingly overpowering idea that society needs a\nmechanism to keep it on the right course \u2013 something that surpasses democracy, autocracy, or any\n\u2018regular\u2019 forms of governing.13 Still, the point remains essentially the same: forces of history are too\nhaphazard to be left to carry out their course on their own: humanity as a whole needs some kind of\nguardianship to guide it through the ever-present crises.\n\nAs I have argued, the Carlylean conception of Great Man history leads to narratives that\nfocus on the management skills and ingenious ways of manipulation devised by robber barons and\nmerchant princes, and projects worlds where history is made in backroom deals by power elites that\nclaim to work for the benefit of the masses. In the end, it seems that the ideas of authoritarianism\nand determinism in Campbellian science fiction are a mixture of Enlightenment ideals, positivism\nand optimism with regard to possibilities of scientific advance, all tempered with cynicism about\nthe   nature   of   human   government   and   history.   The   crisis-centered   and   authoritarian-steered\nconception of history and societal dynamics enables the Great Men to take control, but it also forces\n\n12          Jameson   (2007)   and   Freedman   (2000)   talk   about   the   unattainable   nature   of   the   utopia   which   critical   utopias   have   to\nacknowledge, and while Asimov\u2019s work is rather far from this, it nevertheless circles around similar issues and in its own pragmatic\nway problematizes the whole idea of building utopias.\n13     This is something that Asimov begins exploring in Foundation\u2019s Edge and Foundation and Earth with the idea of a galaxy-wide\ncollective consciousness, Galaxia.\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n19\n\n\fJari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\n\nManaging and Manipulating History\n\nthem to work tirelessly to find the most immediately effective ways of managing the course of\nhumanity.   This   dynamic   may   carry   implications   of   deterministic   conceptions   of   history,   but\nalthough it has sometimes been viewed as a sign of mere pessimism and cynicism about history and\ngovernment, the Campbellian heroes, as I have argued here, nevertheless take this dynamic as an\nexhortation to actively do all they can to assume guardianship over society and to make the best of\nthe situation.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAbbott,   Carl.

In Ings'\ncyberpunk fiction, the use of a particular novum, a programmable cerebral tissue\ncalled \u201cdatafat\u201d, enables elaborate experimentation on different theories of mind\nand matter. Due to this experimentation, Ings\u2019 work is able to convey a conception\nof cognition as an  emergent  effect produced  in  material  processes  that are both\nhuman and non-human. Ings\u2019 work asserts the human subject as a complex system\nin a complex technological ecology and, consequentially, presents us with a model\nfor subjectivity that might be called \u201cposthuman\u201d.\n\nKeywords: Simon Ings, Hot Head, Hotwire, posthuman subjectivity, posthumanism, philosophy of\nneuroscience in literature, complex systems in literature\n\nBiography and contact info: Kaisa Kortekallio is a doctoral student in the Doctoral Programme for\nPhilosophy, Arts and Society at the University of Helsinki.

The   capitalized   \u201cMan\u201d   no   longer   provides   a   useful   model   for\nidentification   \u2013   rather,   there   is   an   acute   need   for   non-anthropocentric   models   of   thought   and\npractice. In search of a functional model of operating in the complex technological, ecological and\nsocial environments, many people turn to science \u2013 and scientists, such as deGrasse Tyson, who can\ncraft information into intuitively meaningful sentences.\n\nSome people take the additional step of approaching science through cultural criticism. The\nparadigmatic   shift   from   humanist   and   idealist   models   of   thought   to   scientific   and   materialist\nthinking has not passed humanists unnoticed:  it is the driving force behind many contemporary\nphilosophical   approaches,   such   as   the   different   critiques   of   classical   humanism   (see   Soper,\nSheehan),   and   interdisciplinary   work   in   fields   such   as   ecocriticism,   cognitive   literary   studies,\nDarwinist literary studies, literature and science, animal studies and feminist science studies (see\n\u00c5sberg   et   al   222).   Conversations   about   the   ideologies   and   assumptions   present   in   scientific\ndiscourse and practices have been lead for decades by critics such as N. Katherine Hayles, Evelyn\nFox Keller and Donna J. Haraway.\n\nStill, there is more work to be done. One of the areas that call for a more detailed mapping is\nthe construction and mutation of subjective experience, especially in the literature most interested in\nthe scientific mode of thought: science fiction. In contemporary philosophy, there are innumerable\ntheoretical approaches to subjectivity, and the modern and postmodern representations of subjective\nexperience have been thoroughly studied in scholarship focusing on \u201cmainstream\u201d literary fiction.\nThe study of science fiction, however, has not taken up the challenge in quite the same way \u2013 partly\ndue   to   the   preconception   that   science-fictional   characters   are   not   interesting,   philosophically\nspeaking.  They have been dubbed  as flat rather than round, types rather than individuals, mere\ndevices for presenting ideas and plot (see Mandala 119\u2013124, Jones 171).\n\nThis may be true in many cases. However, there are works of science fiction that speculate\nnot only about technological progression or scientific theories, but also about the potential and\nalternative developments of human subjectivity. I suggest that in the early novels of British writer\nSimon Ings, subjectivity is rewritten in particularly interesting ways. Ings' novels Hot Head (1992)\nand Hotwire (1995), combining technological speculation and gritty milieus with neurophilosophy\nand metafictional narration, can be characterized as late cyberpunk. Although Ings has been lauded\nas an original voice in the field of science fiction (and later as a writer of postmodern fiction closer\nto the literary mainstream)  his work has not previously received attention from critics within the\nacademy.\n\nThe  primary goal of the article  is to show how  ideas derived from second-order systems\ntheory and cognitive science are involved in the represented experience of fictional characters, and\nhow this process relates to the concept of \u201cposthuman\u201d In particular, I focus on analyzing how the\nmodel of subjects as complex systems evokes a sense of posthuman subjectivity. I argue that 1)\nscience   fiction   literature   is   essential   for   understanding   the   on-going   reassessment   of   human\nsubjectivity in relation to non-human systems, and 2) that Ings\u2019 novels  Hot Head  and  Hotwire\nprovide a particularly profound model of posthuman subjectivity. All in all, the article is an attempt\nat applying a posthumanist approach to the study of literature.\n\nThe method of analysis in this article is far from perfect. There are brilliant analytical tools\nand concepts developed in cognitive narratology and cognitive stylistics, and utilizing them would\ndefinitely   provide   a   deeper   understanding   of   represented   experience.   However,   at   the   time   of\nconducting my analyses, I was still unsure of the ideological underpinnings of these approaches,\nand wanted to avoid blind commitment to traditions. As a result, except for the occasional use of\nnarratological   concepts,   the   reading   follows   loose   intuitive   logic   based   on  metaphorical   and\nanalogical thinking. I am tracing certain structures of thought \u2013 resonant similarities between Ings\u2019\n\n24\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fKaisa Kortekallio\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 23\u201340\n\nnarration   and   scientific   theories.  This   logic   is   inspired   by   the   insightful   readings   made   by   N.\nKatherine Hayles (in How We Became Posthuman) and Sherryl Vint (in Bodies of Tomorrow).\n\nThe   questioning  also   employs   a  phenomenological  mode:   what   could   it   mean,   on   the\nexperiential   level,   to   be   posthuman?  I   approach   fictional   characters   as   potential   models   for\nsubjectivity \u2013 as experimental positions for a curious reader. I am well aware that this immersive\napproach   involves   the   risk   of   antropomorphizing   textual   constructs.   I   find   the   risk   not   only\nacceptable,   but   necessary.   For   me,   the   reflective   flickering   between   alternative   perspectives   \u2013\nreading characters as people and as processes \u2013 is an integral part of the job description of a literary\nresearcher.\n\nThe  article involves a heavy load of references to scientific theorization. Even though my\napproach allows for no in-depth analysis of most theoretical aspects, I find it necessary to work\ntowards  a synthesis  that involves perspectives  from both natural sciences and humanities.  This\nstance is dictated by the source material at hand: in order to fully appreciate the complexity of this\nsort of science fiction, the research needs to be informed by a multitude of approaches. In his\nfiction, Simon Ings samples the theories of complex systems and cognition and integrates them into\na   postmodern   literary   narrative.   To   leave   out   the   natural-scientific   aspect   of   this   elaborate\nconstruction would be neglectful. By utilizing multiple perspectives \u2013 provided by second-order\nsystems theory,  the  philosophy of neuroscience and posthumanist theory \u2013 I also hope to convey\nsome of the challenges ingrained in the posthumanist mode of thought.\n\nPosthumanist Thought and the Search for Posthuman Subjectivities\n\nThe crisis of humanism has informed new conceptions of embodied human subjects \u2013 as biological\nand phenomenological, social and environmental beings. In recent years, theorization identifying as\nposthumanist has worked towards modeling subjectivity in ways that can acknowledge the many\nroles non-human entities and systems play in the formation of subjectivity. Posthumanist models of\nsubjectivity  have   drawn   on   both   the   tradition   of   systems-theoretical   (cybernetic)   thinking   and\npoststructuralist philosophical discourse. As a result, the models often emphasize the processual and\nmaterial aspects of subjectivity.\n\nDespite differences in disciplinary background and methodology, the common ground for\ncontemporary posthumanist thinkers seems to be the critique of certain dualist and idealist strains in\nthe tradition of humanism. Whether posthumanist thinking focuses on questions of nonhuman and\nanimal   agency   and   the   feminist   critique   of   scientific   practices   (see   \u00c5sberg   et   al.)   or   the\nsystems-theoretical approaches to culture and fiction (Clarke, Posthuman Metamorphosis; Wolfe),\nthere   is   an   ongoing   search   for   theories   and   models   of   subjectivity   that   can   articulate   life,\nconsciousness, action and emotion in materialist and non-anthropocentrist terms. In this search,\nposthumanist thinkers often engage in conversation with natural sciences and technology studies\n(with variable amounts of interdisciplinary critique). The tradition of interdisciplinarity goes back to\nthe early development of cybernetics in the 1940s, and especially to the Macy Conferences that\nbrought together scholars from fields ranging from psychology and anthropology to mathematical\nphysics and information technology (see Hayles, Clarke and Hansen).1\n\nThe \u201cpost\u201d in \u201cposthumanism\u201d should not be considered as a total break from the tradition\nof   humanism,   but   as   a   critical   deconstruction   of   it   \u2013   in   the   sense   of   Lyotard\u2019s   paradoxical\n\n1      Another major current of influence to posthumanist thought consists of the work of materialist and empiricist philosophers \u2013\nfrom Leibniz, Hume and Spinoza to Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari. This genealogy has lead to coining the term \u201cnew materialism\u201d,\nreferring to a philosophical approach intertwined with posthumanist thought. Posthumanist discussions (especially the strains that\nemphasize animal ethics) are also closely linked to different forms of cultural activism such as the animal rights movement and deep\necology.   For   two   exemplary   accounts   on   genealogies   of   posthumanism,   see   Neil   Badmington's   introduction   to   the   reader\nPosthumanism and the editors\u2019 introduction to NORA Magazine's issue on \u201cpost-humanities\u201d.\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n25\n\n\fKaisa Kortekallio\n\nModels of Posthuman Subjectivity\n\npostmodernism   that   happens   both   before   and   after   modernism   (Wolfe   xiv-xv)   or   as   a   critical\nposition inescapably rooted in humanist assumptions and language (Rabinowitz 42\u201343).  In Cary\nWolfe\u2019s formulation, posthumanism happens \u201cbefore\u201d humanism\n\nin the sense that it names the embodiment and embeddedness of the human being in not just\nits   biological   but   also   its   technological   world,   the   prosthetic   coevolution   of   the   human\nanimal with the technicity of tools and external archival mechanisms (such as language and\nculture) . . . and all of which comes before that historically specific thing called 'the human'\nthat Foucault's archaelogy excavates (xv).2\n\nOn   the   other   hand,   posthumanism   happens   \u201cafter\u201d   humanism   as   the   historical   phenomenon   of\nreconceptualizing the human as entangled in technological, medical, informational and economic\nnetworks \u2013 and the call for a new paradigm of thought to account for these entanglements (xv-xvi).\n\nOften (but not always) the posthumanist discussion is centered around the term \u201cposthuman\u201d\n\u2013 both as a general adjective implying a mode of thought and practice that rewrites the meaning of\nthe   word  \u201chuman\u201d  and   as   a   speculative   figure,  \u201cthe   posthuman\u201d  In   both   syntactic   forms,   the\nposthuman evokes a plethora of alternatives to current models of humanity and subjectivity. In the\ndiscussions emphasizing the liberating aspects of technology, the posthuman is a futuristic figure\nthat   has   transcended   the   boundaries   of   nature,   finitude   and   biological   embodiment:  \u201cthe   fully\ntechnologized successor species to organic Homo sapiens\u201d (Graham 9).  This transhumanist notion\nof   inevitable   advent   of   the   superhuman   is   what   Elaine   Graham   wanted   to   question   with   her\nformulation \u201cpost/human\u201d, to which she attributes a dual function: \u201cThe post/human is that which\nboth confounds but also holds up to scrutiny the terms on which the quintessentially human will be\nconceived\u201d (11). The dual function makes the post/human an analytical device, a shifting node in a\ndynamic   web   of   conversation.   This   nonessentialist   view   has   been   quite   popular   among\nposthumanist scholars after Graham's formulation. It is also what makes the term posthuman \u2013 even\nwithout   the   cautionary   forward  slash  \u2013  so  useful   for  philosophical  discussion.  In  posthumanist\nthought, \u201cposthuman\u201d denotes above all a change in conceptualizing human subjectivity.\n\nIn this article, the use of the terms \u201cposthuman\u201d and \u201cposthuman subjectivity\u201d carries the\nfull   weight   of   the   contexts   and   functions   discussed   above   \u2013   and   hopefully   adds   to   it.  Adding\n\u201csubjectivity\u201d to \u201cposthuman\u201d is in itself quite problematic, as  R. L. Rutsky, among others, has\nnoted. \u201dThe subject\u201d has traditionally signified the one in control, the ruler of a world of objects. To\ncontrol or to be controlled, to be the subject or an object \u2013 this dualism has prevailed. According to\nRutsky, overcoming this dualism is a central challenge to posthumanist thought:\n\n[T]he human subject can only conceive of itself in opposition to the random, just as it seeks\nto control the body, dominate the material world, and narrativize history. On the other hand,\nany notion of the posthuman that is to be more than merely an extension of the human, that\nis to move beyond the dialectic of control and lack of control, superhuman and inhuman,\nmust be premised upon a mutation that is ongoing and immanent. From this perspective,\nthere can be no such thing as a posthuman subject - at least, not in the traditional sense of an\nindividualized, unitary and autonomous subject. (Rutsky 111.)\n\nThe problem of posthuman subjectivity is also approached in second-order systems theory \u2013 or, as\nBruce  Clarke  and Mark  B. N. Hansen  prefer  to  call  it,  neocybernetics.  Neocybernetics, highly\nuninterested   in   individualized   subjects,   shifts   the   emphasis   of   observation   to   the   networks   of\nconnections among systems and environments, both living and nonliving. From this perspective, the\nsubject   appears   to   be   only   a   convention   of   Western   metaphysics,   \u201can   amalgamation\u201d   or   a\n\n2     Andy Clark would even claim that this very openness to \u201cmultiple mergers and coalitions\u201d is what distinguishes Homo sapiens as\na species (Natural Born Cyborgs 7).\n\n26\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fKaisa Kortekallio\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 23\u201340\n\n\u201cnoumenal unity\u201d which deserves no further attention. (Hansen 6.) It is important to note that in\nsystems theory, the definition of a system always involves selection: the boundaries that define a\nsystem   such   as   \u201ca   human   individual\u201d   are   dependable   on   the   question   you   want   to   ask.   For   a\nneocyberneticist, the subject is only a matter of distinction: instead of an individual, one can decide\nto focus on the various psychic and social systems that constitute an individual, or on the interaction\nand   collaboration   between   an   individual   and   its   environment.   The   individual   is   dividable   and\nmergeable. What makes this shift of emphasis urgent in the eyes of the neocyberneticists is the\nincreasing complexification of the living environment.\n\nIn   today's   computational   world,   countless   instances   of   human   agency   \u2013   even   those   as\nmundane   as   making  online  credit   card  and   mortgage  payments,   monitoring   information\nabout the weather or the stock market, even writing letters and sending messages \u2013 occur\nagainst   the   backdrop   of   complex  computational   infrastructures,   which  geographer   Nigel\nThrift has christened with the felicitous name of the \u201ctechnological unconscious\u201d. (Hansen\n117.)\n\nFor   Hansen,   the   central   challenge   for   contemporary   cultural   theorists   involves   the   inevitable\nhybridity   of   systems   and   environments:   how   to   both   recognize   the   certain   consistency   of   the\n\u201chuman mindbody\u201d and to  account  for the certain  non-autonomy  resulting  from its  reliance  to\ninformationally complex environments (ibid.). Hansen's proposal for accounting for this dynamic is\nthe concept of \u201csystem-environment hybrids\u201d or \u201cSEHs\u201d couplings that \u201crealize their autonomy . . .\nthrough a constitutive relation with alterity\u201d. In SEHs, the environmental component cannot be\nconsidered as merely supportive of or trivial to the system. (115.)\n\nIn   cultural   theory,   the   unavoidable   and   constitutive   relation   to   the   (technological)\nenvironment   has   been   approached   through   concepts   such   as   the   cyborg   and   the   hybrid.\nNeomaterialist   theorist  Rosi   Braidotti   addresses   the   contingency   of   systemic   boundaries   by\nsuggesting that the formation of subjectivity (on an experiential level) also involves a process of\ndistinction   and   selection.  In  Braidotti\u2019s   poetic   formulation,   the   experience   of   any   unitary\nsubjectivity, of a grammatical  \u201cI\u201d, is a  \u201cfictional choreography\u201d  (Metamorphoses  22). Braidotti\nwrites:\n\nThe subject is a process, made of constant shifts and negotiations between different levels of\npower and desire, that is to say wilful choice and unconscious drives. Whatever semblance\nof unity there may be, is no God-given essence, but rather the fictional choreography of\nmany levels into one socially operational self. (Ibid.)\n\nIn this line of thought, every self is fictional \u2013 constructed and operated according to models or\nschemas   that   are,   in   turn,   constructed   and   transformed   by   social,   cultural,   psychological   and\nbiological   forces   (Metamorphoses  13).  Despite   the   notion   of   fictionality,   Braidotti   still   sees\nsubjectivity as a valuable ethical and political category. She even promotes the idea of \u201calternative\nfigurations\u201d   or  conceptual   personae  (in   the   deleuzian   sense)   as   empowering   or   affirmative\n\u201csignposts for specific geopolitical and historical locations\u201d (Posthuman  164). The constructivist\nview on subjectivity can be used as an opportunity for intentional change.\n\nConsidered together, these theories pose a challenge. Even if one  accepts  the idea of  the\nsubject as a process or an effect produced in the network of multiple systems and environments,\nwill it always remain just that \u2013 an idea, an intellectual exercise? Can the posthumanist models of\nsubjectivity actually be experienced subjectively? And, translated into a problem specific for the\nstudy of literature: can these models ever take the form of an identifiable literary character, when\ncharacters tend to be just that: individualized, unitary and autonomous, caught in the dialectic of\ncontrol and lack of control?\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n27\n\n\fKaisa Kortekallio\n\nModels of Posthuman Subjectivity\n\nThese   questions   call   for   a   deeper   analysis   of   the   relations   between   the   traditions   of\nhumanism and modernity and the conventional form of literary character \u2013 a continuation of the\nwork already started by such scholars as Daniel Punday, Genie Babb and David Porush. However,\ndue to the restrictions of time and format, I must now approach them with a more thematic reading\nof Simon Ings' novels Hot Head and Hotwire. I start with an introduction to the representations of\nnon-human systems and cognition in cyberpunk literature.\n\nCyberpunk and Cognitive Science\n\nIn   English-language   popular   culture,   non-human   intelligence   has   traditionally   been   depicted   as\nthreatening \u2013 whether it resides in technological, institutional or biological systems. The relation\nbetween a human individual and a non-human system has typically been that of opposition. Just\nthink of such iconic fictions as Brave New World or The Matrix \u2013 both setting the original human\npersonality against a nonpersonal threat. The function of the hero has been to resist assimilation\n(even when it is futile) and retain his individuality at all costs. In science-fictional literature, notable\nreactions to the apparent rise of non-human systems are paranoia about origins, as in Philip K.\nDick's and William S. Burroughs' oeuvres (see Butler), and a form of escapism that hovers between\ntechnophilia   and   technophobia,   as   in  gibsonian   cyberpunk.3  As   a   counterreaction   to   the\nanthropocentric   heroism   of   1970\u2019s   sf   literature,   the   genre   of   cyberpunk   problematized   the\nrelationship   between   human   subjects   and  their   technological   others.  In   particular,   it   mockingly\nquestioned the position of Man as the master of both nature and technological systems. For the\ncyberpunk protagonist, this often meant the loss of autonomy and control \u2013 and in some cases, also\nthe loss of a unitary self-image. (See McGuirk, Slusser, Bukatman.)\n\nCyberpunk is often regarded as particularly hostile towards embodiment and materiality.\nMany  cyberpunk   texts  depict  the  self-dissolving   integration  to   computing  systems   as   a  sort  of\nnirvana,   as   liberation   from   the   constraints   of   flesh.   As   many   critics   have   noted,   this   is   a\ntranshumanist view \u2013 it seeks not to decentralize or redefine the human subject but to extrapolate on\nit, resulting in superhuman or inhuman figures, not posthumans. (See Hayles, Wolmark, Parikka.)\nAs Carol McGuirk has noted, the most novel feature of cyberpunk as a subgenre was its orientation\ntowards the interior: whereas the tradition of \u201chard science fiction\u201d sent its ships to explore outer\nspace, cyberpunk turned to examine the vulnerable inner space of the human mind (114\u2013115). This\norientation is apparent also in Ings\u2019 work. What sets him apart from most cyberpunk writers is his\nremarkable   interest   towards   phenomenological   embodiment   and   cognitive   science.   Indeed,   in\nreading Ings, a basic understanding of recent developments in cognitive science  appears not only\nuseful but crucial. Therefore, a short summary is needed.\n\nIn  the  classical theory of mind, the brain is the seat of human consciousness: a central\ncommander, the subject in a world of objects. However, recent models have also emphasized the\nembodied  and  environmental  aspects of cognitive activity, decentering the rational and conscious\nself.  Andy Clark summarizes this process as a three-stage progression: The first stage (classical\ncognitivism) depicted the mind in terms of a central logic engine, symbolic databases and some\nperipheral \u201csensory\u201d models. The key characteristics of this vision included the ideas of memory as\nretrieval from a stored symbolic database, problem solving as logical inference and cognition as\ncentralized. The environment was seen just as a problem domain and the body as an input device.\nThe  connectionist  view   replaced   these   characteristics   with   the   ideas   of   memory   as   pattern\n\n3      Of course, opposition is not the only way of articulating relations between humans and non-human systems in science fiction.\nThere are literary works, such as Octavia E. Butler's Xenogenesis series, that posit the human subject as an integral part of a larger\ntechno-biological   ecology   \u2013   works   that   do   not   determine   subjectivity   through   modern   notions   of   originality,   individuality   and\nautonomy. In Butler's texts, human subjectivity is produced in social and ecological processes. In this regard, Simon Ings'  Hot Head\nand Hotwire are similar to Butler's work.\n\n28\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fKaisa Kortekallio\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 23\u201340\n\nre-creation, problem solving as pattern completion and pattern transformation, and cognition as\nincreasingly  decentralize",

Therefore, for my purposes here, it is significant to note that the parent is performing the language, the pre-literate child the eyes, and picture books already encourage a binary between these two age extremes. This dual performance brings the characteristics of the dragon uncomfortably close to home by doubling not only the people with the dragons but also the parent/child with one another.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">Adults and children are doubled and divided by the very practice in which they engage through picture books: literacy. John Morgenstern points out ever since children and adults were separated by the rise of schooling and the Victorian Cult of Childhood, children have been regarded by adults as another type of being that is simultaneously the same and different, innocent and barbaric (21-22). In <em>Hush, Little Dragon</em>, the parent and child readers each absorb the mother and child dragon identities, simultaneously taking on the dragon-humanity doubling and this cultural Othering between adults and children over the practice of reading.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">As the performers of language, the reading parent becomes the mother dragon. Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">Meanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">Hence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">In the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby\u2019s \u201ctummy is full you must\"}]}, {\"role\": \"tool-call\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_9wLvCO8W0I5DxP1ihqqUsQjT', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'inspect_file_as_text', 'arguments': {'file_path': 'https://journal.finfar.org/articles/127.pdf', 'question': 'Please extract the passage from Emily Midkiff\u2019s June 2014 article (F\u00e1fnir) that contains the specific word quoted from two different authors in criticism of dragon depictions.

However, the file ends before reaching page\u00a041, where Midkiff\u2019s article would be found.

Therefore, for my purposes here, it is significant to note that the parent is performing the language, the pre-literate child the eyes, and picture books already encourage a binary between these two age extremes. This dual performance brings the characteristics of the dragon uncomfortably close to home by doubling not only the people with the dragons but also the parent/child with one another.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Adults and children are doubled and divided by the very practice in which they engage through picture books: literacy. John Morgenstern points out ever since children and adults were separated by the rise of schooling and the Victorian Cult of Childhood, children have been regarded by adults as another type of being that is simultaneously the same and different, innocent and barbaric (21-22). In <em>Hush, Little Dragon</em>, the parent and child readers each absorb the mother and child dragon identities, simultaneously taking on the dragon-humanity doubling and this cultural Othering between adults and children over the practice of reading.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">As the performers of language, the reading parent becomes the mother dragon. Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Meanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">Hence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.</p>\n<p class=\"basetext\">In the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes.

Short answer\n\nUnfortunately, the file provided does not include the full text of Emily Midkiff\u2019s article \u201cDragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature\u201d (June 2014, Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research, Vol.\u202f1, Issue\u00a02, starting on page\u00a041). Therefore, I cannot extract any passage\u2014including one containing the specific quoted word\u2014from Midkiff\u2019s article.\n\n2. Extremely detailed answer\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the provided file, I found that it contains the front matter, submission details, editorial content, and two complete peer\u2010reviewed articles (by Jari K\u00e4kel\u00e4 on \u201cManaging and Manipulating History: Perpetual Urgency in Asimov and Heinlein\u201d and by Kaisa Kortekallio on \u201cIntuitive Technologies: Models of Posthuman Subjectivity in Simon Ings\u2019 Hot Head and Hotwire\u201d). The table of contents at the beginning lists three articles, with the third being \u201cDragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature\u201d by Emily Midkiff. However, the file ends before reaching page\u00a041, where Midkiff\u2019s article would be found. Consequently, the passage you are requesting\u2014the one featuring a specific word (quoted from two different critics of dragon depictions, used to express distaste towards certain representations of dragons) along with its surrounding context\u2014is not available in the text provided. \n\nBibliographic details available from the file are as follows:\n\u2022 Journal Title: Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research  \n\u2022 Volume/Issue: Volume 1, Issue 2 (2014)  \n\u2022 Publisher/Organization: The Finnish Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (FINFAR)  \n\u2022 Online address: journal.finfar.org  \n\u2022 The table of contents indicates that Emily Midkiff\u2019s article \u201cDragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature\u201d appears following page 40 (presumably beginning on page 41) in this issue.\n\nSince the full text of Midkiff\u2019s contribution is not included in the file you supplied, I am unable to isolate and provide the requested passage along with its context.\n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked\n\nYour question asks for the extraction of a passage from Emily Midkiff\u2019s June 2014 article that features a particular word\u2014a word reportedly quoted from two different critics who express distaste towards how dragons are depicted in children\u2019s literature. Such a passage would have included surrounding context confirming that the term is used critically. While the table of contents confirms that Midkiff\u2019s article is part of this issue (and thus should discuss dragon depictions in children\u2019s literature), the file you provided only contains complete text for the earlier articles and stops before Midkiff\u2019s work appears. \n\nWithout the segment from page 41 onwards (where Midkiff\u2019s article begins), I cannot extract the passage you requested or verify the bibliographic and contextual details regarding the use of that quoted word. If you have access to the complete issue or the full text of Midkiff\u2019s article, please provide that portion so I can accurately extract and present the passage in question.",

Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['numpy', 'json', 'datetime', 'PyPDF2', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'stat', 'time', 'requests', 'torch', 'fractions', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'collections', 'sympy', 'pubchempy', 'pandas', 'os', 'csv', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 're', 'Bio', 'unicodedata', 'queue', 'PIL', 'itertools', 'random', 'xml', 'math', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'io', 'statistics']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.</p>\\\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">Meanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.</p>\\\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">Hence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.</p>\\\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">In the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby\u2019s \u201ctummy is full you must'}]\\n---\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"Calling tools:\\\\n[{'id': 'call_9wLvCO8W0I5DxP1ihqqUsQjT', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'inspect_file_as_text', 'arguments': {'file_path': 'https://journal.finfar.org/articles/127.pdf', 'question': 'Please extract the passage from Emily Midkiff\u2019s June 2014 article (F\u00e1fnir) that contains the specific word quoted from two different authors in criticism of dragon depictions.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['numpy', 'json', 'datetime', 'PyPDF2', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'stat', 'time', 'requests', 'torch', 'fractions', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'collections', 'sympy', 'pubchempy', 'pandas', 'os', 'csv', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 're', 'Bio', 'unicodedata', 'queue', 'PIL', 'itertools', 'random', 'xml', 'math', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'io', 'statistics']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.</p>\\n<p class=\"basetext\">Meanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.</p>\\n<p class=\"basetext\">Hence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.</p>\\n<p class=\"basetext\">In the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby\u2019s \u201ctummy is full you must'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_9wLvCO8W0I5DxP1ihqqUsQjT', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'inspect_file_as_text', 'arguments': {'file_path': 'https://journal.finfar.org/articles/127.pdf', 'question': 'Please extract the passage from Emily Midkiff\u2019s June 2014 article (F\u00e1fnir) that contains the specific word quoted from two different authors in criticism of dragon depictions.

Consequently, the passage you are requesting\u2014the one featuring a specific word (quoted from two different critics of dragon depictions, used to express distaste towards certain representations of dragons) along with its surrounding context\u2014is not available in the text provided. \\n\\nBibliographic details available from the file are as follows:\\n\u2022 Journal Title: Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research  \\n\u2022 Volume/Issue: Volume 1, Issue 2 (2014)  \\n\u2022 Publisher/Organization: The Finnish Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (FINFAR)  \\n\u2022 Online address: journal.finfar.org  \\n\u2022 The table of contents indicates that Emily Midkiff\u2019s article \u201cDragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature\u201d appears following page 40 (presumably beginning on page 41) in this issue.\\n\\nSince the full text of Midkiff\u2019s contribution is not included in the file you supplied, I am unable to isolate and provide the requested passage along with its context.\\n\\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked\\n\\nYour question asks for the extraction of a passage from Emily Midkiff\u2019s June 2014 article that features a particular word\u2014a word reportedly quoted from two different critics who express distaste towards how dragons are depicted in children\u2019s literature. Such a passage would have included surrounding context confirming that the term is used critically. While the table of contents confirms that Midkiff\u2019s article is part of this issue (and thus should discuss dragon depictions in children\u2019s literature), the file you provided only contains complete text for the earlier articles and stops before Midkiff\u2019s work appears. \\n\\nWithout the segment from page 41 onwards (where Midkiff\u2019s article begins), I cannot extract the passage you requested or verify the bibliographic and contextual details regarding the use of that quoted word. If you have access to the complete issue or the full text of Midkiff\u2019s article, please provide that portion so I can accurately extract and present the passage in question.'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_0N332BIcYsuVgpese3mkjufW', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'final_answer', 'arguments': {'answer': '### 1.

Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.</p>\\\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">Meanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.</p>\\\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">Hence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.</p>\\\\n<p class=\\\"basetext\\\">In the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby\u2019s \u201ctummy is full you must'}]\\n---\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"Calling tools:\\\\n[{'id': 'call_9wLvCO8W0I5DxP1ihqqUsQjT', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'inspect_file_as_text', 'arguments': {'file_path': 'https://journal.finfar.org/articles/127.pdf', 'question': 'Please extract the passage from Emily Midkiff\u2019s June 2014 article (F\u00e1fnir) that contains the specific word quoted from two different authors in criticism of dragon depictions.

Emily Midkiff\u2019s article, titled \u201cDragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature,\u201d is scheduled to appear starting on page 41 of Volume 1, Issue 2 (June 2014). The file available, however, only includes complete text for the earlier articles and stops before reaching Midkiff\u2019s piece. This means that the full text of Midkiff\u2019s article, including the critical passage with the specific quoted word (which is cited as coming from two different authors expressing distaste for dragon depictions), is not present.\n\nThe bibliographic details confirmed from the file include:\n\u2022 Journal Title: Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research\n\u2022 Volume/Issue: Volume 1, Issue 2 (June 2014)\n\u2022 Publisher/Organization: The Finnish Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (FINFAR)\n\u2022 Online address: journal.finfar.org\n\nWithout access to the complete article text starting from page 41, it is not possible to locate the passage or verify that the quoted word indeed expresses distaste for dragon depictions.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe request aimed to identify a passage where two critics\u2019 opinions (quoted within the article) converge on using a specific word that criticizes dragon depictions. Unfortunately, as the complete text for Midkiff\u2019s article is not provided, we cannot extract the excerpt or confirm the details of the quotation. If you have access to the full version of the article or can provide additional text from page 41 onward, I would be able to further pursue extracting and confirming the specific passage and corresponding bibliographic details.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nHello, could you please help locate and extract the relevant passage from Emily Midkiff\u2019s June 2014 article published in the journal F\u00e1fnir (named for Hreidmar\u2019s son who guarded his treasure) where a specific word is quoted from two different authors in criticism of dragon depictions?

Ashburn writes the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby words: \u201cHush, little dragon, don\u2019t make a sound\u201d (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this lullaby out loud does not read any framing words like \u201cThe mother dragon is singing,\u201d but rather immediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known tune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the mother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally read picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the mother dragon from the child listener\u2019s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon baby from the parent\u2019s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other\u2019s perspective through the performative language.</p>\\n<p class=\"basetext\">Meanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the illustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other aspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are generally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while the parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how they read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young (192). They explain this division as a \u201clearning function\u201d on the part of the children, thus \u201cchildren notice more details than adults do\u201d (193). Children and adults\u2019 areas of expertise further divide them into the eyes and language, accordingly.</p>\\n<p class=\"basetext\">Hence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual details of this book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother dragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, \u201cIf those musketeers should bolt, / Mama\u2019s gonna stop their silly revolt\u201d (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but without much menace. The use of the word \u201csilly\u201d belittles their need to run away at all. The slightly forced use of the word \u201crevolt\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbolt\u201d implies more of a political maneuver than a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help dampen any potential scariness in the words.</p>\\n<p class=\"basetext\">In the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across the opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the frame of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an animal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a dragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified musketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer hat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one lonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never shows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting away if it weren\u2019t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the pictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd words and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby\u2019s \u201ctummy is full you must'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_9wLvCO8W0I5DxP1ihqqUsQjT', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'inspect_file_as_text', 'arguments': {'file_path': 'https://journal.finfar.org/articles/127.pdf', 'question': 'Please extract the passage from Emily Midkiff\u2019s June 2014 article (F\u00e1fnir) that contains the specific word quoted from two different authors in criticism of dragon depictions.

However, the file ends before reaching page\\xa041, where Midkiff\u2019s article would be found.
