Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

Extremely detailed answer\nThe very first scene heading in the script reads exactly as follows:\n\n1\nINT. THE CASTLE - DAY\n\nThis is the opening heading of the script (from the Blue Draft dated 24/08/15) that introduces the setting \u2013 an ancient, sprawling castle whose shifting, labyrinthine corridors serve as the ever\u2010shifting maze in which the Doctor finds himself trapped.\n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked\nThe document provided is the official Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 \u201cHeaven Sent\u201d script. In this episode the Doctor is confined within a mysterious, constantly reconfiguring castle that functions as a maze designed to torment him. The question requested that we extract the exact wording \u2013 including all formatting and punctuation \u2013 of the first scene heading that identifies this maze. Although the word \u201cmaze\u201d does not appear verbatim in the heading, \u201cINT. THE CASTLE - DAY\u201d is the very first scene heading in the script. In the episode\u2019s context the castle is depicted as an ever\u2010shifting labyrinth (or maze) through which the Doctor must navigate, and this scene heading sets the stage for that environment.",

Facts to look up\n- The official source or repository where the authenticated version of the Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11 (\"Heaven Sent\") script is hosted. This may involve checking official BBC websites, Doctor Who online archives, or authorized script databases.\n- Information on any official files (e.g., .txt, PDF documents) that host the script. The task hints at using tools like \"inspect_file_as_text\" if the document is in a non-html format.\n- Any ancillary guidelines or notes from the source that explain the formatting of scene headings in the script to ensure complete accuracy.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n- From the obtained official script, derive the exact wording (including all punctuation, capitalization, and formatting) of the first scene heading that references the ever\u2010shifting maze.\n- Logically determine which scene heading in the script qualifies as the first one that identifies the maze, ensuring that it is indeed the correct and official segment as intended by the task.\n- Confirm that the extracted text exactly matches the official text, by comparing it with the original source, ensuring no deviations in formatting or content.\n```",

Extremely detailed answer\nThe very first scene heading in the script reads exactly as follows:\n\n1\nINT. THE CASTLE - DAY\n\nThis is the opening heading of the script (from the Blue Draft dated 24/08/15) that introduces the setting \u2013 an ancient, sprawling castle whose shifting, labyrinthine corridors serve as the ever\u2010shifting maze in which the Doctor finds himself trapped.\n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked\nThe document provided is the official Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 \u201cHeaven Sent\u201d script. In this episode the Doctor is confined within a mysterious, constantly reconfiguring castle that functions as a maze designed to torment him. The question requested that we extract the exact wording \u2013 including all formatting and punctuation \u2013 of the first scene heading that identifies this maze. Although the word \u201cmaze\u201d does not appear verbatim in the heading, \u201cINT. THE CASTLE - DAY\u201d is the very first scene heading in the script. In the episode\u2019s context the castle is depicted as an ever\u2010shifting labyrinth (or maze) through which the Doctor must navigate, and this scene heading sets the stage for that environment.",

Colonnades, and chambers, and\nfountains, and libraries ... All in dusty ancient stone.\n\nMoving closer over details: in every room, mounted somewhere\non the wall is a Cog Unit - a mechanical fixture that looks\nlike it could move the whole wall.\n\nTHE DOCTOR (cont\u2019d)\n\n(V.O.)\n\nWherever you go, whatever path you\ntake, it will follow; never faster,\nnever slower, always coming.\n\nNow, tracking along a floor. Sprinkles of blood, streaks of\nit, like someone, terribly injured has been hauling\nthemselves along.\n\nTHE DOCTOR (cont\u2019d)\n\n(V.O.)\n\nYou will run - it will walk. You\nwill rest - it will not.\n\nNow travelling along those corridors, picking out details.\n\nEvery now and then, incongruously, there is a television\nmonitor wired into the wall.

TELEPORT CHAMBER/CASTLE - DAY\n\n2\n\nA circular chamber of ancient, but active, technology. Brass\nand glass. Intricate mechanisms, spinning and ticking and\nglittering everywhere.

Starting to\ntake familiar shape -\n\nThe cogs - faster and faster.\n\nOn the bloodied hand still writing - we see curves and lines\nbut not the finished word.\n\nThe hand starts to glow. Spasms in pain - steaming now. In a\nmoment the hand crumbles to the barest outline of ash.\n\nOn the brass cogs. They all slam to a halt.\n\nCutting to the stone cogs on all the walls - also slamming to\na halt.\n\nNow on the glass cabinet at the centre of the chamber.\n\nThe golden glow is resolving, refining -\n\n- now clearly, this is the Doctor.\n\nHe is frozen for a moment -\n\n- then convulses into life.

Slams\nagainst the glass of the cabinet, starts to register where he\nis.\n\nA moment to recover.\n\nNow he\u2019s opening the door of the cabinet, stepping into the\ngleaming brass and glass room. Looking around.\n\nA haunted look crosses his face. A memory impacting,\nsickeningly.\n\nFLASHBACK: Clara\u2019s death from Trap Street.\n\nThe Doctor: she\u2019s dead, she\u2019s gone. Nothing he can do.\n\nSo. To business.\n\nHe glances round. A studied show of indifference to his\nsurroundings.\n\nStraightens his coat. Composes himself.

The floor seems covered in some strange ashy\nsubstance - almost as if the floor itself were made of a\ncompacted version of it. It clearly piles up in the corners.\nHe runs the dust through his fingers. What is that? Doesn\u2019t\nmatter. He dusts it from his hands, steps to the door.

Four corridors, at\nregular intervals, give off radially from this circle. They\nare labeled North, South, East and West. There are windows\ntoo. He\u2019s clearly in a tower.\n\nThe Doctor steps to one of the windows.\n\nA very high tower - and encircled by another, much larger\nbuilding.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['time', 'random', 'zipfile', 'numpy', 'pydub', 'datetime', 'stat', 'itertools', 'sklearn', 'xml', 'io', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'fractions', 'PyPDF2', 'queue', 'torch', 'pptx', 'pubchempy', 'requests', 'math', 'scipy', 'chess', 'yahoo_finance', 'collections', 'os', 'pandas', 're', 'sympy', 'csv', 'Bio', 'json', 'unicodedata', 'PIL']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['time', 'random', 'zipfile', 'numpy', 'pydub', 'datetime', 'stat', 'itertools', 'sklearn', 'xml', 'io', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'fractions', 'PyPDF2', 'queue', 'torch', 'pptx', 'pubchempy', 'requests', 'math', 'scipy', 'chess', 'yahoo_finance', 'collections', 'os', 'pandas', 're', 'sympy', 'csv', 'Bio', 'json', 'unicodedata', 'PIL']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

THE CASTLE - DAY\\n\\nThis is the opening heading of the script (from the Blue Draft dated 24/08/15) that introduces the setting \u2013 an ancient, sprawling castle whose shifting, labyrinthine corridors serve as the ever\u2010shifting maze in which the Doctor finds himself trapped.\\n\\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked\\nThe document provided is the official Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 \u201cHeaven Sent\u201d script. In this episode the Doctor is confined within a mysterious, constantly reconfiguring castle that functions as a maze designed to torment him. The question requested that we extract the exact wording \u2013 including all formatting and punctuation \u2013 of the first scene heading that identifies this maze. Although the word \u201cmaze\u201d does not appear verbatim in the heading, \u201cINT. THE CASTLE - DAY\u201d is the very first scene heading in the script. In the episode\u2019s context the castle is depicted as an ever\u2010shifting labyrinth (or maze) through which the Doctor must navigate, and this scene heading sets the stage for that environment.'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Calling tools:\\n[{\\'id\\': \\'call_JSo9VYyAS6JbhpM1AcGgh4Rv\\', \\'type\\': \\'function\\', \\'function\\': {\\'name\\': \\'final_answer\\', \\'arguments\\': {\\'answer\\': \\'### 1.
