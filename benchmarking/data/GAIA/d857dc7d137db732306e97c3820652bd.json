This may involve:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Searching within the site (or using its internal data) to count how many rule titles include \u201cwitnesses\u201d for each article.  \n\u2022 The identification of the \"first rule\" in that particular article\u2014meaning the highest-ranked or earliest rule according to some ordering on the website.  \n\u2022 The amendment history for that rule on the target website, including detailed documentation of amendments and, specifically, the last amendment.  \n\u2022 The record of what word was deleted in that last amendment, which may be found in amendment notes, footnotes, or revision summaries on the website (or an associated resource).\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive which exact section is the \u201cfifth section\u201d alphabetically among the federal rules (by listing and ordering the sections).  \n\u2022 From the data of rule titles, derive which article has the highest count of titles containing \u201cwitnesses\u201d as of 2021.  \n\u2022 Identify, by logical reasoning or ordering, the \u201cfirst rule\u201d in that identified article.  \n\u2022 Analyze the amendment history of that rule to derive the specific change made in the last amendment, specifically isolating the word that was deleted.  \n\u2022 Confirm via logical cross-checking that the derived word indeed comes from the last amendment of the rule in question.\n```\n\nNow begin!

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['requests', 'bs4', 'csv', 'xml', 'fractions', 'pandas', 're', 'numpy', 'PyPDF2', 'math', 'unicodedata', 'sympy', 'torch', 'queue', 'sklearn', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'pptx', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'os', 'random', 'time', 'pydub', 'Bio', 'PIL', 'stat', 'scipy', 'json', 'collections', 'zipfile', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 'statistics']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['requests', 'bs4', 'csv', 'xml', 'fractions', 'pandas', 're', 'numpy', 'PyPDF2', 'math', 'unicodedata', 'sympy', 'torch', 'queue', 'sklearn', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'pptx', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'os', 'random', 'time', 'pydub', 'Bio', 'PIL', 'stat', 'scipy', 'json', 'collections', 'zipfile', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 'statistics']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task refers to Cornell Law School\u2019s Legal Information Institute website.  \n\u2022 It specifically involves the federal rules as organized on that website.  \n\u2022 The rules are organized alphabetically, and our target is within the fifth section alphabetically.  \n\u2022 The task asks for the word that was deleted (i.e., removed) in the last amendment to a specific rule.  \n\u2022 The specific rule is described as: the first rule in the article that, as of 2021, has the most titles containing the word \u201cwitnesses.\u201d  \n\u2022 It is indicated that all necessary tools and data are available for finding the correct answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The exact URL or section on the Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute site where the federal rules are listed and sorted alphabetically.  \n\u2022 How the federal rules are divided alphabetically into sections, and specifically identifying which rules fall into the fifth section.  \n\u2022 A method or list to determine which \"article\" (i.e., collection or grouping of rules) has the most rule titles containing the word \u201cwitnesses\u201d as of the year 2021. This may involve:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Searching within the site (or using its internal data) to count how many rule titles include \u201cwitnesses\u201d for each article.  \n\u2022 The identification of the \"first rule\" in that particular article\u2014meaning the highest-ranked or earliest rule according to some ordering on the website.  \n\u2022 The amendment history for that rule on the target website, including detailed documentation of amendments and, specifically, the last amendment.  \n\u2022 The record of what word was deleted in that last amendment, which may be found in amendment notes, footnotes, or revision summaries on the website (or an associated resource).\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive which exact section is the \u201cfifth section\u201d alphabetically among the federal rules (by listing and ordering the sections).  \n\u2022 From the data of rule titles, derive which article has the highest count of titles containing \u201cwitnesses\u201d as of 2021.  \n\u2022 Identify, by logical reasoning or ordering, the \u201cfirst rule\u201d in that identified article.  \n\u2022 Analyze the amendment history of that rule to derive the specific change made in the last amendment, specifically isolating the word that was deleted.  \n\u2022 Confirm via logical cross-checking that the derived word indeed comes from the last amendment of the rule in question.\n```",
