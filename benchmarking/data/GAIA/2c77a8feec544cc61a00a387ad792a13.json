DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'statistics', 're', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'stat', 'numpy', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'yahoo_finance', 'requests', 'time', 'fractions', 'collections', 'datetime', 'xml', 'sympy', 'json', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'queue', 'torch', 'chess', 'pubchempy', 'sklearn', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'csv', 'math', 'random', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'os']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The complete, authoritative text of \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d by Audre Lorde.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: To accurately determine which stanza has indented lines, we must refer to a reliable version of the poem that shows stanza breaks and formatting details.  \\n\u2002\u2002Location suggestions: Reputable poetry websites (such as Poetry Foundation or official literary archives), academic databases, or printed collections of Audre Lorde\u2019s work might contain the needed formatted text.  \\n\u2022 Information on the standard formatting or published edition of the poem that confirms how stanzas and indentations are numbered or presented.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Different editions might have variations in stanza numbering or formatting; knowing which edition is authoritative is crucial in determining the correct stanza number.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \\n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'statistics', 're', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'stat', 'numpy', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'yahoo_finance', 'requests', 'time', 'fractions', 'collections', 'datetime', 'xml', 'sympy', 'json', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'queue', 'torch', 'chess', 'pubchempy', 'sklearn', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'csv', 'math', 'random', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task concerns Audre Lorde\u2019s poem \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost.\u201d  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The poem\u2019s title and author are explicitly provided.  \n\u2022 The specific query is to determine the number of the stanza in which some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The task clearly asks for the stanza number where indentation occurs.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The complete, authoritative text of \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d by Audre Lorde.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: To accurately determine which stanza has indented lines, we must refer to a reliable version of the poem that shows stanza breaks and formatting details.  \n\u2002\u2002Location suggestions: Reputable poetry websites (such as Poetry Foundation or official literary archives), academic databases, or printed collections of Audre Lorde\u2019s work might contain the needed formatted text.  \n\u2022 Information on the standard formatting or published edition of the poem that confirms how stanzas and indentations are numbered or presented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Different editions might have variations in stanza numbering or formatting; knowing which edition is authoritative is crucial in determining the correct stanza number.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\n\n```",

DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'statistics', 're', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'stat', 'numpy', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'yahoo_finance', 'requests', 'time', 'fractions', 'collections', 'datetime', 'xml', 'sympy', 'json', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'queue', 'torch', 'chess', 'pubchempy', 'sklearn', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'csv', 'math', 'random', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'os']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \\n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'statistics', 're', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'stat', 'numpy', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'yahoo_finance', 'requests', 'time', 'fractions', 'collections', 'datetime', 'xml', 'sympy', 'json', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'queue', 'torch', 'chess', 'pubchempy', 'sklearn', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'csv', 'math', 'random', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task concerns Audre Lorde\u2019s poem \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost.\u201d  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The poem\u2019s title and author are explicitly provided.  \n\u2022 The specific query is to determine the number of the stanza in which some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The task clearly asks for the stanza number where indentation occurs.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The complete, authoritative text of \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d by Audre Lorde.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: To accurately determine which stanza has indented lines, we must refer to a reliable version of the poem that shows stanza breaks and formatting details.  \n\u2002\u2002Location suggestions: Reputable poetry websites (such as Poetry Foundation or official literary archives), academic databases, or printed collections of Audre Lorde\u2019s work might contain the needed formatted text.  \n\u2022 Information on the standard formatting or published edition of the poem that confirms how stanzas and indentations are numbered or presented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Different editions might have variations in stanza numbering or formatting; knowing which edition is authoritative is crucial in determining the correct stanza number.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\n\n```",

DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'statistics', 're', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'stat', 'numpy', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'yahoo_finance', 'requests', 'time', 'fractions', 'collections', 'datetime', 'xml', 'sympy', 'json', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'queue', 'torch', 'chess', 'pubchempy', 'sklearn', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'csv', 'math', 'random', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'os']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \\n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city} population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'statistics', 're', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'stat', 'numpy', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'yahoo_finance', 'requests', 'time', 'fractions', 'collections', 'datetime', 'xml', 'sympy', 'json', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'queue', 'torch', 'chess', 'pubchempy', 'sklearn', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'csv', 'math', 'random', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task concerns Audre Lorde\u2019s poem \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost.\u201d  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The poem\u2019s title and author are explicitly provided.  \n\u2022 The specific query is to determine the number of the stanza in which some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The task clearly asks for the stanza number where indentation occurs.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The complete, authoritative text of \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d by Audre Lorde.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: To accurately determine which stanza has indented lines, we must refer to a reliable version of the poem that shows stanza breaks and formatting details.  \n\u2002\u2002Location suggestions: Reputable poetry websites (such as Poetry Foundation or official literary archives), academic databases, or printed collections of Audre Lorde\u2019s work might contain the needed formatted text.  \n\u2022 Information on the standard formatting or published edition of the poem that confirms how stanzas and indentations are numbered or presented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Different editions might have variations in stanza numbering or formatting; knowing which edition is authoritative is crucial in determining the correct stanza number.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\n\n```",

If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'statistics', 're', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'stat', 'numpy', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'yahoo_finance', 'requests', 'time', 'fractions', 'collections', 'datetime', 'xml', 'sympy', 'json', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'queue', 'torch', 'chess', 'pubchempy', 'sklearn', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'csv', 'math', 'random', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'os']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \\n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'statistics', 're', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'stat', 'numpy', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'yahoo_finance', 'requests', 'time', 'fractions', 'collections', 'datetime', 'xml', 'sympy', 'json', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'queue', 'torch', 'chess', 'pubchempy', 'sklearn', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'csv', 'math', 'random', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task concerns Audre Lorde\u2019s poem \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost.\u201d  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The poem\u2019s title and author are explicitly provided.  \n\u2022 The specific query is to determine the number of the stanza in which some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The task clearly asks for the stanza number where indentation occurs.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The complete, authoritative text of \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d by Audre Lorde.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: To accurately determine which stanza has indented lines, we must refer to a reliable version of the poem that shows stanza breaks and formatting details.  \n\u2002\u2002Location suggestions: Reputable poetry websites (such as Poetry Foundation or official literary archives), academic databases, or printed collections of Audre Lorde\u2019s work might contain the needed formatted text.  \n\u2022 Information on the standard formatting or published edition of the poem that confirms how stanzas and indentations are numbered or presented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Different editions might have variations in stanza numbering or formatting; knowing which edition is authoritative is crucial in determining the correct stanza number.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\n\n```",

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The complete, authoritative text of \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d by Audre Lorde.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: To accurately determine which stanza has indented lines, we must refer to a reliable version of the poem that shows stanza breaks and formatting details.  \\n\u2002\u2002Location suggestions: Reputable poetry websites (such as Poetry Foundation or official literary archives), academic databases, or printed collections of Audre Lorde\u2019s work might contain the needed formatted text.  \\n\u2022 Information on the standard formatting or published edition of the poem that confirms how stanzas and indentations are numbered or presented.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Different editions might have variations in stanza numbering or formatting; knowing which edition is authoritative is crucial in determining the correct stanza number.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \\n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task concerns Audre Lorde\u2019s poem \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost.\u201d  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The poem\u2019s title and author are explicitly provided.  \n\u2022 The specific query is to determine the number of the stanza in which some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The task clearly asks for the stanza number where indentation occurs.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The complete, authoritative text of \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d by Audre Lorde.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: To accurately determine which stanza has indented lines, we must refer to a reliable version of the poem that shows stanza breaks and formatting details.  \n\u2002\u2002Location suggestions: Reputable poetry websites (such as Poetry Foundation or official literary archives), academic databases, or printed collections of Audre Lorde\u2019s work might contain the needed formatted text.  \n\u2022 Information on the standard formatting or published edition of the poem that confirms how stanzas and indentations are numbered or presented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Different editions might have variations in stanza numbering or formatting; knowing which edition is authoritative is crucial in determining the correct stanza number.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\n\n```",

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The complete, authoritative text of \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d by Audre Lorde.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: To accurately determine which stanza has indented lines, we must refer to a reliable version of the poem that shows stanza breaks and formatting details.  \\n\u2002\u2002Location suggestions: Reputable poetry websites (such as Poetry Foundation or official literary archives), academic databases, or printed collections of Audre Lorde\u2019s work might contain the needed formatted text.  \\n\u2022 Information on the standard formatting or published edition of the poem that confirms how stanzas and indentations are numbered or presented.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Different editions might have variations in stanza numbering or formatting; knowing which edition is authoritative is crucial in determining the correct stanza number.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \\n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2003\u2022 The task centers on Audre Lorde\u2019s poem \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 The specific question is: \u201cIn Audre Lorde\u2019s poem \u2018Father Son and Holy Ghost\u2019, what is the number of the stanza in which some lines are indented?\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 It is critical that the answer be correct, based on reliable evidence from an authoritative, fully formatted version of the poem.\n\n2. Facts that we have learned\n\u2003\u2022 Several attempts have been made to request an authoritative version of the poem along with clear formatting details (stanza numbering and indication of any indented lines).\n\u2003\u2022 Our search queries (via the search_agent) have repeatedly returned the request message, but no formatted text or explicit answer has been provided.\n\u2003\u2022 We now know that identifying the specific stanza requires an authoritative version of the poem with clear formatting, which we have not yet obtained.\n\n3. Facts still to look up\n\u2003\u2022 An authoritative, fully formatted version of Audre Lorde\u2019s \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d that shows the stanza breaks and any special formatting like indented lines.\n\u2003\u2022 Reputable sources (academic databases, literary archives, or publisher-approved editions) that confirm the stanza numbering and formatting details of this poem.\n\u2003\u2022 Evidence or excerpts from such a version that clearly indicate which stanza has the indented lines.\n\n4. Facts still to derive\n\u2003\u2022 Using the authoritative formatted text once it is located, determine exactly which stanza (by number) contains indented lines.\n\u2003\u2022 Validate that the identified formatted specifications (stanza numbering and indentation) are consistent across at least one additional reputable source, to ensure the derived answer is correct.\n```\n\nNow for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\nBeware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.\nAfter writing the final step of the plan, write the '\\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.\n\nNow write your new plan below.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task concerns Audre Lorde\u2019s poem \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost.\u201d  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The poem\u2019s title and author are explicitly provided.  \n\u2022 The specific query is to determine the number of the stanza in which some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The task clearly asks for the stanza number where indentation occurs.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The complete, authoritative text of \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d by Audre Lorde.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: To accurately determine which stanza has indented lines, we must refer to a reliable version of the poem that shows stanza breaks and formatting details.  \n\u2002\u2002Location suggestions: Reputable poetry websites (such as Poetry Foundation or official literary archives), academic databases, or printed collections of Audre Lorde\u2019s work might contain the needed formatted text.  \n\u2022 Information on the standard formatting or published edition of the poem that confirms how stanzas and indentations are numbered or presented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Different editions might have variations in stanza numbering or formatting; knowing which edition is authoritative is crucial in determining the correct stanza number.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\n\n```",

DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'statistics', 're', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'stat', 'numpy', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'yahoo_finance', 'requests', 'time', 'fractions', 'collections', 'datetime', 'xml', 'sympy', 'json', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'queue', 'torch', 'chess', 'pubchempy', 'sklearn', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'csv', 'math', 'random', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'os']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 The complete, authoritative text of \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d by Audre Lorde.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: To accurately determine which stanza has indented lines, we must refer to a reliable version of the poem that shows stanza breaks and formatting details.  \\n\u2002\u2002Location suggestions: Reputable poetry websites (such as Poetry Foundation or official literary archives), academic databases, or printed collections of Audre Lorde\u2019s work might contain the needed formatted text.  \\n\u2022 Information on the standard formatting or published edition of the poem that confirms how stanzas and indentations are numbered or presented.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Different editions might have variations in stanza numbering or formatting; knowing which edition is authoritative is crucial in determining the correct stanza number.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \\n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \\n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'statistics', 're', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'stat', 'numpy', 'pptx', 'PyPDF2', 'yahoo_finance', 'requests', 'time', 'fractions', 'collections', 'datetime', 'xml', 'sympy', 'json', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'queue', 'torch', 'chess', 'pubchempy', 'sklearn', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'csv', 'math', 'random', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task concerns Audre Lorde\u2019s poem \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost.\u201d  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The poem\u2019s title and author are explicitly provided.  \n\u2022 The specific query is to determine the number of the stanza in which some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: The task clearly asks for the stanza number where indentation occurs.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The complete, authoritative text of \u201cFather Son and Holy Ghost\u201d by Audre Lorde.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: To accurately determine which stanza has indented lines, we must refer to a reliable version of the poem that shows stanza breaks and formatting details.  \n\u2002\u2002Location suggestions: Reputable poetry websites (such as Poetry Foundation or official literary archives), academic databases, or printed collections of Audre Lorde\u2019s work might contain the needed formatted text.  \n\u2022 Information on the standard formatting or published edition of the poem that confirms how stanzas and indentations are numbered or presented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Different editions might have variations in stanza numbering or formatting; knowing which edition is authoritative is crucial in determining the correct stanza number.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The specific stanza number where some lines are indented.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: Once the verified text is obtained, a careful examination must be undertaken\u2014identifying each stanza, checking for any indented lines, and then logically determining which numbered stanza contains them.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that the indentation is not a result of line breaks or other formatting, but a deliberate stylistic indentation within that stanza.  \n\u2002\u2002Reasoning: This ensures that the derived answer is based on intentional formatting choices made in the poem\u2019s official presentation.\n\n```",
