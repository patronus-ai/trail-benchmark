Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nBased on authoritative historical pricing data and analyses\u2014which include the use of the Google Finance GOOGLEFINANCE function (as documented on the Google Docs Editors Help page) and cross\u2010referenced with external historical price records from sources such as Macrotrends and Finbox\u2014it appears that Apple\u2019s raw closing prices (prices reported before being adjusted for subsequent stock splits) first exceeded the $50 threshold in 1987. This conclusion is drawn from the following reasoning:\n\n\u2022 Apple went public in December 1980 at an IPO price of approximately $22 per share. At that time, the raw price data was not adjusted since no splits had occurred yet.\n\u2022 In the subsequent years leading up to the company\u2019s first stock split in 1987, Apple experienced a rally. Historical charts and analyses (from platforms that track unadjusted data) indicate that the closing prices climbed steadily during the mid-1980s.\n\u2022 By 1987, before the adjustments from subsequent stock splits, documented raw pricing records show that Apple\u2019s closing price crossed the $50 mark for the first time.\n\u2022 It is important to note that while the GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets typically returns split-adjusted data, analysts seeking the raw data can cross-reference with dedicated historical data platforms that maintain the original unadjusted prices.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe distinction between raw and split-adjusted pricing is critical. Google Finance documentation shows how to retrieve historical security information, yet it usually provides split-adjusted figures by default. Therefore, to pinpoint milestones based solely on the unadjusted trading values\u2014such as the first time Apple\u2019s stock closed above $50\u2014external validations from sources like Macrotrends and Finbox are used. These confirm that 1987 is indeed the correct year according to the criteria specified.",

Task outcome (short version):\nApple Inc.\u2019s raw (non\u2013split-adjusted) stock price first closed above $50 in 1987.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nBased on authoritative historical pricing data and analyses\u2014which include the use of the Google Finance GOOGLEFINANCE function (as documented on the Google Docs Editors Help page) and cross\u2010referenced with external historical price records from sources such as Macrotrends and Finbox\u2014it appears that Apple\u2019s raw closing prices (that is, prices reported before being adjusted for subsequent stock splits) first exceeded the $50 threshold in 1987. This conclusion is drawn from the following reasoning:\n\n\u2022 Apple went public in December 1980 at an IPO price of approximately $22 per share. At that time, the raw price data was not adjusted since no splits had occurred yet.\n\u2022 In the subsequent years leading up to the company\u2019s first stock split (which occurred in 1987), Apple experienced a rally. Historical charts and analyses (from platforms that track unadjusted data) indicate that the closing prices climbed steadily during the mid-1980s.\n\u2022 By 1987, before the adjustment effects of the imminent stock splits, documented raw pricing records show that Apple\u2019s closing price crossed the $50 mark for the first time.\n\u2022 It should be noted that while the GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets provides a straightforward method to retrieve historical security information, its standard output is typically split\u2010adjusted. As a result, analysts seeking to pinpoint the raw, non\u2013split\u2010adjusted data often cross-reference with dedicated historical data platforms that maintain unadjusted price series.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe distinction between raw and split\u2010adjusted pricing is critical in financial analysis. Google Finance documentation (for example, the help page on the GOOGLEFINANCE function) demonstrates how current and historical data can be fetched, but does not explicitly segregate between raw and adjusted figures. Consequently, when the requirement is to identify a raw (non\u2013split\u2010adjusted) price milestone, such as the first closing above $50 for Apple Inc., external validations via sites like Macrotrends and Finbox become invaluable. These platforms provide charts and numerical series that present the original, unadjusted trading values\u2014confirming that 1987 marks the year when Apple\u2019s raw closing price first surpassed $50, before any adjustments for the several stock splits the company has undergone since that time.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nHello, can you please search for authoritative information or documentation on Google Finance regarding Apple Inc.'s historical (non\u2013split-adjusted) stock prices?

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nApple Inc.\u2019s raw (non\u2013split-adjusted) stock price first closed above $50 in 1987.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nBased on authoritative historical pricing data and analyses\u2014which include the use of the Google Finance GOOGLEFINANCE function (as documented on the Google Docs Editors Help page) and cross\u2010referenced with external historical price records from sources such as Macrotrends and Finbox\u2014it appears that Apple\u2019s raw closing prices (that is, prices reported before being adjusted for subsequent stock splits) first exceeded the $50 threshold in 1987. This conclusion is drawn from the following reasoning:\\\\n\\\\n\u2022 Apple went public in December 1980 at an IPO price of approximately $22 per share. At that time, the raw price data was not adjusted since no splits had occurred yet.\\\\n\u2022 In the subsequent years leading up to the company\u2019s first stock split (which occurred in 1987), Apple experienced a rally. Historical charts and analyses (from platforms that track unadjusted data) indicate that the closing prices climbed steadily during the mid-1980s.\\\\n\u2022 By 1987, before the adjustment effects of the imminent stock splits, documented raw pricing records show that Apple\u2019s closing price crossed the $50 mark for the first time.\\\\n\u2022 It should be noted that while the GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets provides a straightforward method to retrieve historical security information, its standard output is typically split\u2010adjusted. As a result, analysts seeking to pinpoint the raw, non\u2013split\u2010adjusted data often cross-reference with dedicated historical data platforms that maintain unadjusted price series.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nThe distinction between raw and split\u2010adjusted pricing is critical in financial analysis. Google Finance documentation (for example, the help page on the GOOGLEFINANCE function) demonstrates how current and historical data can be fetched, but does not explicitly segregate between raw and adjusted figures. Consequently, when the requirement is to identify a raw (non\u2013split\u2010adjusted) price milestone, such as the first closing above $50 for Apple Inc., external validations via sites like Macrotrends and Finbox become invaluable. These platforms provide charts and numerical series that present the original, unadjusted trading values\u2014confirming that 1987 marks the year when Apple\u2019s raw closing price first surpassed $50, before any adjustments for the several stock splits the company has undergone since that time.'}}}]\"}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['requests', 'PyPDF2', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 're', 'time', 'pandas', 'csv', 'yahoo_finance', 'sympy', 'json', 'stat', 'PIL', 'numpy', 'zipfile', 'random', 'math', 'xml', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'statistics', 'pydub', 'itertools', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'datetime', 'pptx', 'os', 'queue', 'chess', 'collections', 'torch', 'pubchempy', 'Bio']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city} population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['requests', 'PyPDF2', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 're', 'time', 'pandas', 'csv', 'yahoo_finance', 'sympy', 'json', 'stat', 'PIL', 'numpy', 'zipfile', 'random', 'math', 'xml', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'statistics', 'pydub', 'itertools', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'datetime', 'pptx', 'os', 'queue', 'chess', 'collections', 'torch', 'pubchempy', 'Bio']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Task outcome (short version):\nApple Inc.\u2019s raw (non\u2013split-adjusted) stock price first closed above $50 in 1987.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nBased on authoritative historical pricing data and analyses\u2014which include the use of the Google Finance GOOGLEFINANCE function (as documented on the Google Docs Editors Help page) and cross\u2010referenced with external historical price records from sources such as Macrotrends and Finbox\u2014it appears that Apple\u2019s raw closing prices (that is, prices reported before being adjusted for subsequent stock splits) first exceeded the $50 threshold in 1987. This conclusion is drawn from the following reasoning:\n\n\u2022 Apple went public in December 1980 at an IPO price of approximately $22 per share. At that time, the raw price data was not adjusted since no splits had occurred yet.\n\u2022 In the subsequent years leading up to the company\u2019s first stock split (which occurred in 1987), Apple experienced a rally. Historical charts and analyses (from platforms that track unadjusted data) indicate that the closing prices climbed steadily during the mid-1980s.\n\u2022 By 1987, before the adjustment effects of the imminent stock splits, documented raw pricing records show that Apple\u2019s closing price crossed the $50 mark for the first time.\n\u2022 It should be noted that while the GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets provides a straightforward method to retrieve historical security information, its standard output is typically split\u2010adjusted. As a result, analysts seeking to pinpoint the raw, non\u2013split\u2010adjusted data often cross-reference with dedicated historical data platforms that maintain unadjusted price series.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe distinction between raw and split\u2010adjusted pricing is critical in financial analysis. Google Finance documentation (for example, the help page on the GOOGLEFINANCE function) demonstrates how current and historical data can be fetched, but does not explicitly segregate between raw and adjusted figures. Consequently, when the requirement is to identify a raw (non\u2013split\u2010adjusted) price milestone, such as the first closing above $50 for Apple Inc., external validations via sites like Macrotrends and Finbox become invaluable. These platforms provide charts and numerical series that present the original, unadjusted trading values\u2014confirming that 1987 marks the year when Apple\u2019s raw closing price first surpassed $50, before any adjustments for the several stock splits the company has undergone since that time.",

You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

Make sure to use this parameter if you're trying to search for articles from a specific date!\", 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_page: Visit a webpage at a given URL and return its text. Given a url to a YouTube video, this returns the transcript.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The relative or absolute url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_up: Scroll the viewport UP one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_down: Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_on_page_ctrl_f: Scroll the viewport to the first occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for. Give this date in the format 'YYYYMMDD', for instance '27 June 2008' is written as '20080627'.\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Use page search functions (Ctrl+F) on the documentation to look for keywords like \"raw,\" \"non-adjusted,\" \"split,\" and \"Apple\" to identify any direct references or guidelines.\n4. If the documentation does not explicitly detail raw pricing methodology for Apple Inc., search for external authoritative resources or financial data platforms (such as Yahoo Finance, StatMuse, or Finbox) that display historical charts specifically showing non\u2013split-adjusted (raw) closing prices for Apple Inc.\n5. Identify and inspect a chart or historical data source that clearly displays the raw closing prices for Apple Inc. to pinpoint when the price first closed above $50.\n6. Analyze the timeline/data from the chart to determine the first year in which Apple\u2019s raw closing price exceeded $50, ensuring to note any details regarding stock splits that influence the raw prices.\n7. Synthesize all gathered information and document the findings, including references to the Google Finance documentation (or equivalent reliable data source) and any key charts or numerical data that support the determination of the first year.\n8.

Historical charts and analyses (from platforms that track unadjusted data) indicate that the closing prices climbed steadily during the mid-1980s.\n\u2022 By 1987, before the adjustments from subsequent stock splits, documented raw pricing records show that Apple\u2019s closing price crossed the $50 mark for the first time.\n\u2022 It is important to note that while the GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets typically returns split-adjusted data, analysts seeking the raw data can cross-reference with dedicated historical data platforms that maintain the original unadjusted prices.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe distinction between raw and split-adjusted pricing is critical. Google Finance documentation shows how to retrieve historical security information, yet it usually provides split-adjusted figures by default. Therefore, to pinpoint milestones based solely on the unadjusted trading values\u2014such as the first time Apple\u2019s stock closed above $50\u2014external validations from sources like Macrotrends and Finbox are used. These confirm that 1987 is indeed the correct year according to the criteria specified.",

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6.

Task outcome (short version):\\nApple Inc.\u2019s raw (non\u2013split-adjusted) stock price first closed above $50 in 1987.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nBased on authoritative historical pricing data and analyses\u2014which include the use of the Google Finance GOOGLEFINANCE function (as documented on the Google Docs Editors Help page) and cross\u2010referenced with external historical price records from sources such as Macrotrends and Finbox\u2014it appears that Apple\u2019s raw closing prices (that is, prices reported before being adjusted for subsequent stock splits) first exceeded the $50 threshold in 1987. This conclusion is drawn from the following reasoning:\\n\\n\u2022 Apple went public in December 1980 at an IPO price of approximately $22 per share. At that time, the raw price data was not adjusted since no splits had occurred yet.\\n\u2022 In the subsequent years leading up to the company\u2019s first stock split (which occurred in 1987), Apple experienced a rally. Historical charts and analyses (from platforms that track unadjusted data) indicate that the closing prices climbed steadily during the mid-1980s.\\n\u2022 By 1987, before the adjustment effects of the imminent stock splits, documented raw pricing records show that Apple\u2019s closing price crossed the $50 mark for the first time.\\n\u2022 It should be noted that while the GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets provides a straightforward method to retrieve historical security information, its standard output is typically split\u2010adjusted. As a result, analysts seeking to pinpoint the raw, non\u2013split\u2010adjusted data often cross-reference with dedicated historical data platforms that maintain unadjusted price series.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nThe distinction between raw and split\u2010adjusted pricing is critical in financial analysis. Google Finance documentation (for example, the help page on the GOOGLEFINANCE function) demonstrates how current and historical data can be fetched, but does not explicitly segregate between raw and adjusted figures. Consequently, when the requirement is to identify a raw (non\u2013split\u2010adjusted) price milestone, such as the first closing above $50 for Apple Inc., external validations via sites like Macrotrends and Finbox become invaluable. These platforms provide charts and numerical series that present the original, unadjusted trading values\u2014confirming that 1987 marks the year when Apple\u2019s raw closing price first surpassed $50, before any adjustments for the several stock splits the company has undergone since that time.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \\\"New task:\\\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nHello, can you please search for authoritative information or documentation on Google Finance regarding Apple Inc.'s historical (non\u2013split-adjusted) stock prices?

Task outcome (short version):\\\\\\\\nApple Inc.\u2019s raw (non\u2013split-adjusted) stock price first closed above $50 in 1987.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\\\\\nBased on authoritative historical pricing data and analyses\u2014which include the use of the Google Finance GOOGLEFINANCE function (as documented on the Google Docs Editors Help page) and cross\u2010referenced with external historical price records from sources such as Macrotrends and Finbox\u2014it appears that Apple\u2019s raw closing prices (that is, prices reported before being adjusted for subsequent stock splits) first exceeded the $50 threshold in 1987. This conclusion is drawn from the following reasoning:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\u2022 Apple went public in December 1980 at an IPO price of approximately $22 per share. At that time, the raw price data was not adjusted since no splits had occurred yet.\\\\\\\\n\u2022 In the subsequent years leading up to the company\u2019s first stock split (which occurred in 1987), Apple experienced a rally. Historical charts and analyses (from platforms that track unadjusted data) indicate that the closing prices climbed steadily during the mid-1980s.\\\\\\\\n\u2022 By 1987, before the adjustment effects of the imminent stock splits, documented raw pricing records show that Apple\u2019s closing price crossed the $50 mark for the first time.\\\\\\\\n\u2022 It should be noted that while the GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets provides a straightforward method to retrieve historical security information, its standard output is typically split\u2010adjusted. As a result, analysts seeking to pinpoint the raw, non\u2013split\u2010adjusted data often cross-reference with dedicated historical data platforms that maintain unadjusted price series.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\\\\\nThe distinction between raw and split\u2010adjusted pricing is critical in financial analysis. Google Finance documentation (for example, the help page on the GOOGLEFINANCE function) demonstrates how current and historical data can be fetched, but does not explicitly segregate between raw and adjusted figures. Consequently, when the requirement is to identify a raw (non\u2013split\u2010adjusted) price milestone, such as the first closing above $50 for Apple Inc., external validations via sites like Macrotrends and Finbox become invaluable. These platforms provide charts and numerical series that present the original, unadjusted trading values\u2014confirming that 1987 marks the year when Apple\u2019s raw closing price first surpassed $50, before any adjustments for the several stock splits the company has undergone since that time.'}}}]\\\"}]\\n---\\n</summary_of_work>\"}]}], \"stop_sequences\": [\"<end_code>\", \"Observation:\"], \"grammar\": null, \"tools_to_call_from\": null, \"kwargs\": {}}",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['requests', 'PyPDF2', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 're', 'time', 'pandas', 'csv', 'yahoo_finance', 'sympy', 'json', 'stat', 'PIL', 'numpy', 'zipfile', 'random', 'math', 'xml', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'statistics', 'pydub', 'itertools', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'datetime', 'pptx', 'os', 'queue', 'chess', 'collections', 'torch', 'pubchempy', 'Bio']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Task outcome (short version):\nApple Inc.\u2019s raw (non\u2013split-adjusted) stock price first closed above $50 in 1987.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nBased on authoritative historical pricing data and analyses\u2014which include the use of the Google Finance GOOGLEFINANCE function (as documented on the Google Docs Editors Help page) and cross\u2010referenced with external historical price records from sources such as Macrotrends and Finbox\u2014it appears that Apple\u2019s raw closing prices (that is, prices reported before being adjusted for subsequent stock splits) first exceeded the $50 threshold in 1987. This conclusion is drawn from the following reasoning:\n\n\u2022 Apple went public in December 1980 at an IPO price of approximately $22 per share. At that time, the raw price data was not adjusted since no splits had occurred yet.\n\u2022 In the subsequent years leading up to the company\u2019s first stock split (which occurred in 1987), Apple experienced a rally. Historical charts and analyses (from platforms that track unadjusted data) indicate that the closing prices climbed steadily during the mid-1980s.\n\u2022 By 1987, before the adjustment effects of the imminent stock splits, documented raw pricing records show that Apple\u2019s closing price crossed the $50 mark for the first time.\n\u2022 It should be noted that while the GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets provides a straightforward method to retrieve historical security information, its standard output is typically split\u2010adjusted. As a result, analysts seeking to pinpoint the raw, non\u2013split\u2010adjusted data often cross-reference with dedicated historical data platforms that maintain unadjusted price series.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe distinction between raw and split\u2010adjusted pricing is critical in financial analysis. Google Finance documentation (for example, the help page on the GOOGLEFINANCE function) demonstrates how current and historical data can be fetched, but does not explicitly segregate between raw and adjusted figures. Consequently, when the requirement is to identify a raw (non\u2013split\u2010adjusted) price milestone, such as the first closing above $50 for Apple Inc., external validations via sites like Macrotrends and Finbox become invaluable. These platforms provide charts and numerical series that present the original, unadjusted trading values\u2014confirming that 1987 marks the year when Apple\u2019s raw closing price first surpassed $50, before any adjustments for the several stock splits the company has undergone since that time.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nHello, can you please search for authoritative information or documentation on Google Finance regarding Apple Inc.'s historical (non\u2013split-adjusted) stock prices?

Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded.\nRun verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer!\nHere is the task:\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\nTo output the final answer, use the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]\nYour FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your FINAL ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and DO NOT INCLUDE UNITS such as $ or USD or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, output 'FINAL ANSWER: Unable to determine'\n",
