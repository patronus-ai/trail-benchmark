Facts to look up\n\u2022 Confirming the album: Verify that Michael Jackson\u2019s sixth studio album is in fact \u201cThriller.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: Michael Jackson\u2019s discography entries (e.g., an official discography website, album liner notes, or Wikipedia).  \n\u2022 Determining the order of singles from that album: Validate that the fifth single released from \u201cThriller\u201d is \u201cHuman Nature.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: Official release history on a verified site (such as Wikipedia\u2019s \u201cThriller (album)\u201d page or official music industry sources).  \n\u2022 Obtaining the official lyrics for the identified fifth single (\u201cHuman Nature\u201d): We need the full, authoritative lyrics to pinpoint the location of the second chorus and determine the last word immediately preceding it.  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: Official lyrics publications, licensed lyrics websites (e.g., Genius, AZLyrics, or an official Michael Jackson website).\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Derive the exact structure of the song \u201cHuman Nature\u201d: Identify where the first chorus ends and the second chorus begins, ensuring the correct verse or transition is located.  \n\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: By analyzing the standard structure of the song (verses, bridges, choruses), determine which segment immediately precedes the second chorus.  \n\u2022 Derive the \u201clast word\u201d before the second chorus: Once the song structure is clear, extract the final word of the section immediately preceding the start of the second chorus.  \n\u2003\u2013 Reasoning: Read and analyze the lyrics carefully to locate the transition point and then select the last word before that point.\n```\n\nNow begin!

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools.
