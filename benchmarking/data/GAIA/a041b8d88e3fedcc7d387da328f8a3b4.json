Unfortunately, when I went back about a month later on April 21, it was no longer on the dinner menu.  Using the Wayback Machine, can you help me figure out which main course was on the dinner menu for Virtue on March 22, 2021 but not April 21, 2021? Answer using the singular form, without articles.\n```\nYou can leverage these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The restaurant is Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: We know exactly which establishment\u2019s menu we have to inspect.  \n\u2022 The two specific dates mentioned are March 22, 2021 and April 21, 2021.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: The task involves comparing the dinner menus on these two dates.  \n\u2022 The March 22, 2021 dinner menu included a main course that the diner described as \"delicious\" that is no longer present on the April 21, 2021 dinner menu.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This clear discrepancy in the menus is the focus of the query.  \n\u2022 The task instructs the use of the Wayback Machine to retrieve relevant website snapshots.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This implies that historical web archives are necessary to review the menus for these dates.  \n\u2022 The final answer must be provided in the singular form and without articles.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This is a specific formatting requirement for the answer submission.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The archived dinner menu of Virtue restaurant & bar on March 22, 2021 from the Wayback Machine.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This snapshot is needed to identify what main courses were available (and to extract the \u201cdelicious\u201d main course mentioned).  \n\u2003\u2003Source: Wayback Machine website (archive.org) using the restaurant\u2019s official website URL.  \n\u2022 The archived dinner menu of Virtue restaurant & bar on April 21, 2021 from the Wayback Machine.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This snapshot is necessary to compare with the March 22 menu and determine which main course was removed.  \n\u2003\u2003Source: Wayback Machine website (archive.org) with the specific snapshot for April 21, 2021.  \n\u2022 The exact URL or domain where Virtue restaurant & bar lists its dinner menu.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: Having the correct URL will help locate the appropriate pages within the Wayback Machine archives.  \n\u2003\u2003Source: The restaurant\u2019s official website or referenced sources provided in the task if any.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Identify the list of main courses from the March 22, 2021 dinner menu snapshot.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: Extracting this list will show which main courses were officially offered on that date.  \n\u2022 Identify the list of main courses from the April 21, 2021 dinner menu snapshot.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This list will reveal the changes made to the dinner menu after March 22, 2021.  \n\u2022 Through comparison, derive which main course is present on March 22, 2021\u2019s menu but absent on April 21, 2021\u2019s menu.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This difference directly answers the query about which \"delicious\" main course was removed.  \n\u2022 Ensure that the final dish identification is expressed in singular form and without any articles.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: Compliance with the task\u2019s required answer format ensures correct submission.\n```\n\nNow begin!

DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5.

Facts to derive\n\u2022 Identify the list of main courses from the March 22, 2021 dinner menu snapshot.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: Extracting this list will show which main courses were officially offered on that date.  \n\u2022 Identify the list of main courses from the April 21, 2021 dinner menu snapshot.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This list will reveal the changes made to the dinner menu after March 22, 2021.  \n\u2022 Through comparison, derive which main course is present on March 22, 2021\u2019s menu but absent on April 21, 2021\u2019s menu.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This difference directly answers the query about which \"delicious\" main course was removed.  \n\u2022 Ensure that the final dish identification is expressed in singular form and without any articles.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: Compliance with the task\u2019s required answer format ensures correct submission.\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The restaurant is Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: We know exactly which establishment\u2019s menu we have to inspect.  \n\u2022 The two specific dates mentioned are March 22, 2021 and April 21, 2021.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: The task involves comparing the dinner menus on these two dates.  \n\u2022 The March 22, 2021 dinner menu included a main course that the diner described as \"delicious\" that is no longer present on the April 21, 2021 dinner menu.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This clear discrepancy in the menus is the focus of the query.  \n\u2022 The task instructs the use of the Wayback Machine to retrieve relevant website snapshots.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This implies that historical web archives are necessary to review the menus for these dates.  \n\u2022 The final answer must be provided in the singular form and without articles.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This is a specific formatting requirement for the answer submission.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The archived dinner menu of Virtue restaurant & bar on March 22, 2021 from the Wayback Machine.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This snapshot is needed to identify what main courses were available (and to extract the \u201cdelicious\u201d main course mentioned).  \n\u2003\u2003Source: Wayback Machine website (archive.org) using the restaurant\u2019s official website URL.  \n\u2022 The archived dinner menu of Virtue restaurant & bar on April 21, 2021 from the Wayback Machine.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This snapshot is necessary to compare with the March 22 menu and determine which main course was removed.  \n\u2003\u2003Source: Wayback Machine website (archive.org) with the specific snapshot for April 21, 2021.  \n\u2022 The exact URL or domain where Virtue restaurant & bar lists its dinner menu.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: Having the correct URL will help locate the appropriate pages within the Wayback Machine archives.  \n\u2003\u2003Source: The restaurant\u2019s official website or referenced sources provided in the task if any.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Identify the list of main courses from the March 22, 2021 dinner menu snapshot.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: Extracting this list will show which main courses were officially offered on that date.  \n\u2022 Identify the list of main courses from the April 21, 2021 dinner menu snapshot.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This list will reveal the changes made to the dinner menu after March 22, 2021.  \n\u2022 Through comparison, derive which main course is present on March 22, 2021\u2019s menu but absent on April 21, 2021\u2019s menu.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This difference directly answers the query about which \"delicious\" main course was removed.  \n\u2022 Ensure that the final dish identification is expressed in singular form and without any articles.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: Compliance with the task\u2019s required answer format ensures correct submission.\n```",

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files.

If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['zipfile', 're', 'math', 'json', 'sympy', 'requests', 'queue', 'pptx', 'pubchempy', 'pandas', 'unicodedata', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'collections', 'os', 'csv', 'sklearn', 'fractions', 'itertools', 'statistics', 'chess', 'stat', 'Bio', 'random', 'yahoo_finance', 'bs4', 'datetime', 'xml', 'io', 'scipy', 'torch', 'PIL', 'time', 'PyPDF2']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['zipfile', 're', 'math', 'json', 'sympy', 'requests', 'queue', 'pptx', 'pubchempy', 'pandas', 'unicodedata', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'collections', 'os', 'csv', 'sklearn', 'fractions', 'itertools', 'statistics', 'chess', 'stat', 'Bio', 'random', 'yahoo_finance', 'bs4', 'datetime', 'xml', 'io', 'scipy', 'torch', 'PIL', 'time', 'PyPDF2']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The restaurant is Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: We know exactly which establishment\u2019s menu we have to inspect.  \n\u2022 The two specific dates mentioned are March 22, 2021 and April 21, 2021.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: The task involves comparing the dinner menus on these two dates.  \n\u2022 The March 22, 2021 dinner menu included a main course that the diner described as \"delicious\" that is no longer present on the April 21, 2021 dinner menu.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This clear discrepancy in the menus is the focus of the query.  \n\u2022 The task instructs the use of the Wayback Machine to retrieve relevant website snapshots.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This implies that historical web archives are necessary to review the menus for these dates.  \n\u2022 The final answer must be provided in the singular form and without articles.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This is a specific formatting requirement for the answer submission.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The archived dinner menu of Virtue restaurant & bar on March 22, 2021 from the Wayback Machine.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This snapshot is needed to identify what main courses were available (and to extract the \u201cdelicious\u201d main course mentioned).  \n\u2003\u2003Source: Wayback Machine website (archive.org) using the restaurant\u2019s official website URL.  \n\u2022 The archived dinner menu of Virtue restaurant & bar on April 21, 2021 from the Wayback Machine.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This snapshot is necessary to compare with the March 22 menu and determine which main course was removed.  \n\u2003\u2003Source: Wayback Machine website (archive.org) with the specific snapshot for April 21, 2021.  \n\u2022 The exact URL or domain where Virtue restaurant & bar lists its dinner menu.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: Having the correct URL will help locate the appropriate pages within the Wayback Machine archives.  \n\u2003\u2003Source: The restaurant\u2019s official website or referenced sources provided in the task if any.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Identify the list of main courses from the March 22, 2021 dinner menu snapshot.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: Extracting this list will show which main courses were officially offered on that date.  \n\u2022 Identify the list of main courses from the April 21, 2021 dinner menu snapshot.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This list will reveal the changes made to the dinner menu after March 22, 2021.  \n\u2022 Through comparison, derive which main course is present on March 22, 2021\u2019s menu but absent on April 21, 2021\u2019s menu.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: This difference directly answers the query about which \"delicious\" main course was removed.  \n\u2022 Ensure that the final dish identification is expressed in singular form and without any articles.  \n\u2003\u2003Reasoning: Compliance with the task\u2019s required answer format ensures correct submission.\n```",

Unfortunately, when I went back about a month later on April 21, it was no longer on the dinner menu.  Using the Wayback Machine, can you help me figure out which main course was on the dinner menu for Virtue on March 22, 2021 but not April 21, 2021? Answer using the singular form, without articles.\n\nTo output the final answer, use the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]\nYour FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your FINAL ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and DO NOT INCLUDE UNITS such as $ or USD or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, output 'FINAL ANSWER: Unable to determine'\n",
