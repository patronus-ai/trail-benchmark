Made an alphabetical list of all WoW classes: Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Druid, Evoker, Hunter, Mage, Monk, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock, and Warrior.\n4. Opened each page and noted the armor type: Death Knight (plate), Demon Hunter (leather), Druid (leather), Evoker (mail), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Monk (leather), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Rogue (leather), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n5. Looked up \"Kilt of the Forgotten One\" on Google.\n6. Opened https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/item=37616/kilt-of-the-forgotten-one.\n7. Noted that it is leather, and none of the classes can use it, so the remaining classes are: Death Knight (plate), Evoker (mail), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n8. Noted that it was added in Wrath of the Lich King, so if the dungeon is newly released, the era is the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.\n9. Searched \"Wrath of the Lich King class abilities\" on Google.\n10. Opened https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spells/abilities.\n11. Sorted by class and noted that Evokers, Demon Hunters, and Monks did not exist yet, so the remaining classes are: Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n12. Checked which classes use Holy school abilities, Paladin (plate) and Priest (cloth), so they must be in the group as tank and healer.\n13. Checked which classes use ice (Frost) and fire abilities, Death Knight (plate), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warlock (cloth).\n14. There can only be one other plate class, so it must be Death Knight or Warrior, and one other cloth class, so it must be Mage or Warlock.\n15. Metamorphosis is a Warlock ability in Wrath of the Lich King, so it must be the other cloth class, and the group so far is Paladin, Priest, Warlock, plate DPS, and other DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n16. There cannot be another cloth class, so the remaining options are Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n17. There is a bear attacking the boss and there is no Druid to shapeshift into a bear, so it must be a Hunter's pet, making the group Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Hunter, and plate DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n18. The last class is plate, leaving only Death Knight and Warrior.\n19. Hunters and Warlocks can both cast Fire abilities but cannot cast Frost abilities, so the last DPS must cast ice (Frost) abilities, making the last DPS a Frost Death Knight since Warriors have no Frost abilities.\n20. Order the group alphabetically: Death Knight, Hunter, Paladin, Priest, Warlock.",

Made an alphabetical list of all WoW classes: Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Druid, Evoker, Hunter, Mage, Monk, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock, and Warrior.\n4. Opened each page and noted the armor type: Death Knight (plate), Demon Hunter (leather), Druid (leather), Evoker (mail), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Monk (leather), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Rogue (leather), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n5. Looked up \"Kilt of the Forgotten One\" on Google.\n6. Opened https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/item=37616/kilt-of-the-forgotten-one.\n7. Noted that it is leather, and none of the classes can use it, so the remaining classes are: Death Knight (plate), Evoker (mail), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n8. Noted that it was added in Wrath of the Lich King, so if the dungeon is newly released, the era is the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.\n9. Searched \"Wrath of the Lich King class abilities\" on Google.\n10. Opened https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spells/abilities.\n11. Sorted by class and noted that Evokers, Demon Hunters, and Monks did not exist yet, so the remaining classes are: Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n12. Checked which classes use Holy school abilities, Paladin (plate) and Priest (cloth), so they must be in the group as tank and healer.\n13. Checked which classes use ice (Frost) and fire abilities, Death Knight (plate), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warlock (cloth).\n14. There can only be one other plate class, so it must be Death Knight or Warrior, and one other cloth class, so it must be Mage or Warlock.\n15. Metamorphosis is a Warlock ability in Wrath of the Lich King, so it must be the other cloth class, and the group so far is Paladin, Priest, Warlock, plate DPS, and other DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n16. There cannot be another cloth class, so the remaining options are Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n17. There is a bear attacking the boss and there is no Druid to shapeshift into a bear, so it must be a Hunter's pet, making the group Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Hunter, and plate DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n18. The last class is plate, leaving only Death Knight and Warrior.\n19. Hunters and Warlocks can both cast Fire abilities but cannot cast Frost abilities, so the last DPS must cast ice (Frost) abilities, making the last DPS a Frost Death Knight since Warriors have no Frost abilities.\n20.

Two are plate wearers and two are cloth wearers. At the final boss, both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells. Ice and fire are being used, each one by a different DPS.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The group has five members: one tank, one healer, and three DPS.  \n\u2022 At the final boss, both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells.  \n\u2022 Two of the group\u2019s members are plate wearers and two are cloth wearers.  \n\u2022 Among the DPS, one is using an ice ability and a different one is using a fire ability.  \n\u2022 A bear from the group is attacking the boss.  \n\u2022 Someone casts Metamorphosis.  \n\u2022 The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops as loot, but no one can use it.  \n\u2022 All classes in the group are unique and are using their class abilities.  \n\u2022 The setting is a dungeon in World of Warcraft, implicating the specific class traits and abilities of that game.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Which World of Warcraft classes can naturally fulfill the tank role while casting holy spells (for example, by checking official class descriptions or wowwiki).  \n\u2022 Which classes are able to cast holy spells in a healer role (via official WoW guides or wowpedia).  \n\u2022 Which WoW classes are known to specifically use ice and fire abilities as part of their DPS toolkit (consult wowwiki or class-specific resources).  \n\u2022 Which WoW class has a bear-related ability or form (reference wowwiki for druid forms).  \n\u2022 Which WoW class has the ability named \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d (consult wowwiki for Demon Hunter abilities).  \n\u2022 Which classes typically wear plate armor and which wear cloth armor (using official WoW class armor type charts or wowhead).  \n\u2022 Information on \u201cThe Kilt of the Forgotten One\u201d loot drop and its usability restrictions (via wowhead or game databases).\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 Deduce which classes match the given roles and abilities:  \n\u2003\u2013 Identify the tank class that can cast holy spells.  \n\u2003\u2013 Identify the healer class that casts holy spells.  \n\u2003\u2013 Determine which DPS class uses ice-based abilities.  \n\u2003\u2013 Determine which DPS class uses fire-based abilities.  \n\u2003\u2013 Recognize the DPS class indicated by a bear attacking the boss.  \n\u2003\u2013 Determine the class using Metamorphosis.  \n\u2022 Assemble the final set of five unique classes based on the deduction from roles, abilities, and armor types.  \n\u2022 Reconcile the armor type information (two plate wearers and two cloth wearers) with the deduced classes to ensure consistency.  \n\u2022 Arrange the final classes in alphabetical order, separated by commas, as required by the task.\n```",

Note the group composition and roles: one tank, one healer, and three DPS.\n2. Identify from WoW lore which class naturally serves as a holy\u2010casting tank \u2013 this points to the Paladin.\n3. Identify the class that provides holy spells for healing \u2013 this points to the Priest.\n4. From the DPS clues, single out the class with a bear form (used when \u201ca bear is attacking the boss\u201d) \u2013 this is the Druid.\n5. Recognize the unique \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d ability as belonging exclusively to Demon Hunters \u2013 assign the Demon Hunter to a DPS slot.\n6. Determine which DPS remaining class is associated with elemental \u201cice\u201d and \u201cfire\u201d magic \u2013 that is the Mage (using its frost and fire specializations).\n7. Verify that the armor types match: Paladin (plate), Mage and Priest (cloth) and the remaining two (Druid and Demon Hunter) typically wearing leather; thus the \u201ctwo plate, two cloth\u201d count is satisfied by the Paladin plus one other plate not present, meaning the non\u2010plate DPS are not using plate armor.\n8.
