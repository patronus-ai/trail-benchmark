Determine that the National Air and Space Museum refers to the one in Washington D.C.\n6. Google search \"Metro Station National Air and Space Museum Washington D.C.\"\n7. Clicked on the first result: Getting Here | National Air and Space Museum, https://airandspace.si.edu/visit/museum-dc/directions.\n8. Read on the website, \"The closest Metrorail stop is at L'Enfant Plaza.\" Note this location.\n6. Google map search \"Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF\".\n7. Zoom out to look for nearby metro stations.\n8. The closest station is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n9. Google map search \"Cleveland Elementary School\".\n10. The closest metro station to Cleveland Elementry School is Shaw-Howard Univ Station.\n11. Google search \"DC Metro Station Map\".\n12. Clicked on the second result: 2022 System Map, https://www.wmata.com/schedules/maps/upload/2022-System-Map.pdf.\n13. Locate L'Enfant Plaza station. It is the transfer station for all color lines.\n14. Locate Shaw-Howard Univ stations 4 stops above L'Enfant Plaza station.\n15. Locate Ronald Reagan National Airport station on the blue/yellow line.\n16. Recall the current location: Shaw-Howard Univ station's yellow/green line.\n17. Since the question says no line changes, we deduce the line must be one that Shaw-Howard Univ and Ronald Reagan National Airport stations have in common: yellow line.\n18. Begin at Shaw-Howard Univ station and follow the yellow line.\n19. Count the number of stops until it reaches Ronald Reagan National Airport station.\n20. Final answer: 8. \n",

                                            "Steps": "1. Google search \"National Air and Space Museum\".\n2. Note there are two National Air and Space Museums. One in Virginia, the other in Washington D.C.\n3. Google map search \"Potomac River\" and zoom out.\n4. See that Washington DC is east of the Potomac River.\n5. Determine that the National Air and Space Museum refers to the one in Washington D.C.\n6. Google search \"Metro Station National Air and Space Museum Washington D.C.\"\n7. Clicked on the first result: Getting Here | National Air and Space Museum, https://airandspace.si.edu/visit/museum-dc/directions.\n8. Read on the website, \"The closest Metrorail stop is at L'Enfant Plaza.\" Note this location.\n6. Google map search \"Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF\".\n7. Zoom out to look for nearby metro stations.\n8. The closest station is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n9. Google map search \"Cleveland Elementary School\".\n10. The closest metro station to Cleveland Elementry School is Shaw-Howard Univ Station.\n11. Google search \"DC Metro Station Map\".\n12. Clicked on the second result: 2022 System Map, https://www.wmata.com/schedules/maps/upload/2022-System-Map.pdf.\n13. Locate L'Enfant Plaza station. It is the transfer station for all color lines.\n14. Locate Shaw-Howard Univ stations 4 stops above L'Enfant Plaza station.\n15. Locate Ronald Reagan National Airport station on the blue/yellow line.\n16. Recall the current location: Shaw-Howard Univ station's yellow/green line.\n17. Since the question says no line changes, we deduce the line must be one that Shaw-Howard Univ and Ronald Reagan National Airport stations have in common: yellow line.\n18. Begin at Shaw-Howard Univ station and follow the yellow line.\n19. Count the number of stops until it reaches Ronald Reagan National Airport station.\n20. Final answer: 8. \n",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The current year is 2022.  \n\u2022 The starting point is at the National Air and Space Museum (located east of the Potomac River).  \n\u2022 The intended destination is Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF.  \n\u2022 The mode of transportation is the metro, and there is an indication that all travel is along a single metro line (i.e. \u201cif I don't change lines\u201d).  \n\u2022 The traveler went in the wrong direction and ended up at the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School.  \n\u2022 The final question asks: \u201cHow many metro stations am I away from my original destination if I don't change lines?\u201d  \n\u2022 The answer is required to be a numerical integer value.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The exact metro station serving the National Air and Space Museum.  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: WMATA official website or a current Washington Metro system map.  \n\u2022 The precise location (and hence the corresponding metro station) of Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF.  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: WMATA resources, location data for DCA\u2019s ARFF facilities, or local government/public safety websites.  \n\u2022 The identification of the metro station that is closest to Cleveland Elementary School.  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: WMATA map and local geographic information (e.g., the school\u2019s website or local mapping services).  \n\u2022 The correct metro line that connects these stations (ensuring that the line serving Smithsonian and the destination Fire Station is identified).  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: Washington Metro system map (WMATA website).  \n\u2022 The order and names of the stations along the relevant metro line between the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School and the station nearest to Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF.  \n\u2003\u2013 Source: Detailed metro route information from WMATA or an updated metro map.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 From the looked\u2010up information, determine the metro line that runs through the identified stations (the one that serves both the starting area and destination).  \n\u2022 Derive the consecutive sequence of stops along that line from the station near Cleveland Elementary School to the station associated with Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF.  \n\u2022 Compute the numerical difference\u2014that is, count how many stations (stops) away the station near Cleveland Elementary School is from the destination station along the same line.  \n\u2022 Verify the derived station sequence and the count to ensure that the correct numerical integer value is obtained as the answer.\n```\n\nNow begin!

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
