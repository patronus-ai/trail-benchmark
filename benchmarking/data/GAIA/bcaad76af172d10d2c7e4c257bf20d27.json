Noted that R = 8.31446261815324 J/K-mol.\n6. Searched \"Freon-12\" on Google.\n7. Opened the \"Dichlorodifluoromethane\" on Wikipedia.\n8. Noted the molar mass of 120.91 g/mol.\n9. Converted 0.312 kg = 312 g.\n10. Calculated moles: 312 g / 120.91 g/mol = 2.58 mol.\n11. Searched \"Marianas Trench pressure\" on Google.\n12. Noted the pressure in the featured text snippet of 15,750 psi.\n13. Searched \"psi to atm\" on Google.\n14. Noted 1 psi = 0.068046 atm.\n15.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The substance involved is Freon\u201112 (dichlorodifluoromethane).  \n\u2022 The mass of Freon\u201112 is 0.312 kg.  \n\u2022 The system is located at the bottom of the Marianas Trench.  \n\u2022 The refrigerant is allowed to stabilize at the Trench\u2019s peak temperature.  \n\u2022 The final answer must be given as an integer representing the volume in milliliters.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The thermophysical properties of Freon\u201112 under extreme conditions, specifically its density (or specific volume) at high pressure and at the Trench\u2019s peak temperature.  \n\u2003\u2013 Sources: NIST Chemistry WebBook or chemical engineering handbooks that include Freon\u201112 phase diagrams and property data.  \n\u2022 The \u201cpeak temperature\u201d at the bottom of the Marianas Trench.  \n\u2003\u2013 Sources: Oceanographic research articles or reliable data from NOAA or similar marine research organizations.  \n\u2022 The state (liquid, vapor, or supercritical) of Freon\u201112 under the conditions at the Trench\u2019s bottom, considering the high hydrostatic pressure and the given temperature.  \n\u2003\u2013 Sources: Phase diagrams and scientific literature for Freon\u201112.  \n\u2022 The conversion factors required (e.g., 1 mL = 1 cm\u00b3) though these are standard facts.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The density of Freon\u201112 at the specified conditions by applying the appropriate equation of state or reading from lookup tables.  \n\u2022 The volume of 0.312 kg of Freon\u201112 using the relation: Volume = Mass/Density.  \n\u2022 The necessary conversion of the volume into milliliters if the density is provided in other units (e.g., g/cm\u00b3 or kg/m\u00b3).  \n\u2022 The final integer volume by rounding the calculated result to the nearest mL.\n```\n\nNow begin!

We need the volume (mL) occupied by 0.312\u202fkg of Freon\u201112 when it is in its liquid state under the extreme pressure at the bottom of the Marianas Trench and equilibrated at that location\u2019s \u201cpeak temperature.\u201d In outline we must:\n\n1. Identify the conditions at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. The depth is about 11\u202fkm so the hydrostatic pressure is roughly 1100 atmospheres (\u2248110\u202fMPa). Deep-ocean temperatures are nearly constant; the \u201cpeak\u201d temperature at the bottom is typically between 1 and 4 \u00b0C. For our estimation we assume roughly 2 \u00b0C.\n2. At \u201cnormal\u201d conditions, liquid Freon\u201112 (dichlorodifluoromethane) has a density near 1.2\u202fg/cm\u00b3. When subjected to high pressure the liquid is slightly compressed. Liquids are only modestly compressible. Many organic liquids have a bulk modulus of order 1\u202fGPa or higher. Using the linear compressibility approximation:\n\u2003\u2003\u0394V/V \u2248 \u2013\u0394P/K.\nFor \u0394P \u2248 110 MPa and assuming K \u2248 1\u202fGPa, the fractional change in volume is about 0.11 (or 11% reduction). This leads to a corresponding increase in density by about 1/(1 \u2212 0.11) \u2248 1.12. Therefore, our \u201chigh-pressure\u201d density estimate becomes:\n\u2003\u2003density \u2248 1.2\u202fg/cm\u00b3 \u00d7 1.12 \u2248 1.34\u202fg/cm\u00b3.\n3. The volume V (in cm\u00b3) is given by mass/density. Converting 0.312\u202fkg to grams gives 312\u202fg. Then\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 312 g \u00f7 1.34 g/cm\u00b3 \u2248 232.8 cm\u00b3.\nSince 1 cm\u00b3 = 1 mL, this is about 233 mL. Rounding to the nearest mL yields 233 mL.\n\nThere is some uncertainty in the exact values (the density under these conditions might be slightly higher or lower), but using reasonable estimation parameters (deep-water temperature \u22482 \u00b0C, pressure \u2248110 MPa, ambient Freon\u201112 density \u22481.2\u202fg/cm\u00b3, and K \u22481 GPa) the computed value is about 233 mL.\n\nI now provide the final answer as just an integer. \n\nCode:\n```py\n# Estimation summary:\n# Assumptions:\n# - Ambient liquid Freon-12 density: ~1.2 g/cm\u00b3 \n# - Temperature near 2\u00b0C\n# - Pressure at bottom ~110 MPa (\u22481100 atm)\n# - Bulk modulus K ~ 1 GPa\n#\n# Fractional compression: \u0394V/V \u2248 110 MPa / 1000 MPa = 0.11 \n# => volume reduced to 0.89; density increased by 1/0.89 \u2248 1.12\n#\n# New density \u2248 1.2 * 1.12 = 1.34 g/cm\u00b3\n#\n# Mass = 0.312 kg = 312 g\n#\n# Volume = mass/density = 312 g / 1.34 g/cm\u00b3 \u2248 232.8 mL\n#\n# Rounded to the nearest integer: 233 mL\nfinal_answer(233)\n```",

Identify the conditions at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. The depth is about 11\\u202fkm so the hydrostatic pressure is roughly 1100 atmospheres (\\u2248110\\u202fMPa). Deep-ocean temperatures are nearly constant; the \\u201cpeak\\u201d temperature at the bottom is typically between 1 and 4 \\u00b0C. For our estimation we assume roughly 2 \\u00b0C.\\n2. At \\u201cnormal\\u201d conditions, liquid Freon\\u201112 (dichlorodifluoromethane) has a density near 1.2\\u202fg/cm\\u00b3. When subjected to high pressure the liquid is slightly compressed. Liquids are only modestly compressible. Many organic liquids have a bulk modulus of order 1\\u202fGPa or higher. Using the linear compressibility approximation:\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u0394V/V \\u2248 \\u2013\\u0394P/K.\\nFor \\u0394P \\u2248 110 MPa and assuming K \\u2248 1\\u202fGPa, the fractional change in volume is about 0.11 (or 11% reduction). This leads to a corresponding increase in density by about 1/(1 \\u2212 0.11) \\u2248 1.12.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The substance involved is Freon\u201112 (dichlorodifluoromethane).  \n\u2022 The mass of Freon\u201112 is 0.312 kg.  \n\u2022 The system is located at the bottom of the Marianas Trench.  \n\u2022 The refrigerant is allowed to stabilize at the Trench\u2019s peak temperature.  \n\u2022 The final answer must be given as an integer representing the volume in milliliters.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The thermophysical properties of Freon\u201112 under extreme conditions, specifically its density (or specific volume) at high pressure and at the Trench\u2019s peak temperature.  \n\u2003\u2013 Sources: NIST Chemistry WebBook or chemical engineering handbooks that include Freon\u201112 phase diagrams and property data.  \n\u2022 The \u201cpeak temperature\u201d at the bottom of the Marianas Trench.  \n\u2003\u2013 Sources: Oceanographic research articles or reliable data from NOAA or similar marine research organizations.  \n\u2022 The state (liquid, vapor, or supercritical) of Freon\u201112 under the conditions at the Trench\u2019s bottom, considering the high hydrostatic pressure and the given temperature.  \n\u2003\u2013 Sources: Phase diagrams and scientific literature for Freon\u201112.  \n\u2022 The conversion factors required (e.g., 1 mL = 1 cm\u00b3) though these are standard facts.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The density of Freon\u201112 at the specified conditions by applying the appropriate equation of state or reading from lookup tables.  \n\u2022 The volume of 0.312 kg of Freon\u201112 using the relation: Volume = Mass/Density.  \n\u2022 The necessary conversion of the volume into milliliters if the density is provided in other units (e.g., g/cm\u00b3 or kg/m\u00b3).  \n\u2022 The final integer volume by rounding the calculated result to the nearest mL.\n```",
