Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The Biopython library in Python must be used to solve the problem.  \n\u2022 The target protein has the PDB ID \u201c5wb7\u201d from the RCSB Protein Data Bank.  \n\u2022 The task requires parsing a PDB file and computing the distance between the first and second atoms as they appear in the file.  \n\u2022 The computed distance must be reported in Angstroms, with the value rounded to the nearest picometer.  \n\u2022 An attached file is provided and should be used:  \n\u2003\u2003- Attached file: data/gaia/validation/7dd30055-0198-452e-8c25-f73dbe27dcb8.pdb  \n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Documentation for Biopython\u2019s PDB parser (module Bio.PDB) and how it reads PDB files \u2013 available from the official Biopython documentation website.  \n\u2022 Details on how atom records are structured in a PDB file to correctly determine the order of atoms \u2013 can be found on the RCSB PDB website or in introductory materials on the PDB format.  \n\u2022 Conversion details between Angstroms and picometers (to understand the rounding precision), specifically that 1 Angstrom equals 100 picometers \u2013 available on reliable scientific resources or conversion reference websites.  \n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) of the first and second atoms from the parsed PDB file.  \n\u2022 The Euclidean distance between these two atoms using the formula \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2 + (z2 - z1)\u00b2].  \n\u2022 The rounded distance in Angstroms where the rounding is done to the nearest picometer (i.e. to the nearest 0.01 Angstrom given that 1 Angstrom = 100 picometers).\n```\n\nNow begin!

Facts to look up\n\u2022 Documentation for Biopython\u2019s PDB parser (module Bio.PDB) and how it reads PDB files \u2013 available from the official Biopython documentation website.  \n\u2022 Details on how atom records are structured in a PDB file to correctly determine the order of atoms \u2013 can be found on the RCSB PDB website or in introductory materials on the PDB format.  \n\u2022 Conversion details between Angstroms and picometers (to understand the rounding precision), specifically that 1 Angstrom equals 100 picometers \u2013 available on reliable scientific resources or conversion reference websites.  \n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) of the first and second atoms from the parsed PDB file.  \n\u2022 The Euclidean distance between these two atoms using the formula \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2 + (z2 - z1)\u00b2].  \n\u2022 The rounded distance in Angstroms where the rounding is done to the nearest picometer (i.e. to the nearest 0.01 Angstrom given that 1 Angstrom = 100 picometers).\n```",

Identify and extract the first two atom entries (lines starting with \"ATOM\" or \"HETATM\") from the file.\n3. Parse the x, y, and z coordinates for these two atoms according to the PDB file format.\n4. Compute the Euclidean distance between the two atoms using the formula \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2 + (z\u2082 - z\u2081)\u00b2].\n5. Convert the resulting distance (which is in Angstroms) to a value rounded to the nearest picometer (i.e., round to 2 decimal places, since 1 \u00c5 = 100 pm).\n6. Use the final_answer tool to report the computed distance in Angstroms.\n\n\n```",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['PyPDF2', 'json', 'itertools', 'random', 'zipfile', 'requests', 're', 'pydub', 'math', 'stat', 'pandas', 'sympy', 'pubchempy', 'pptx', 'Bio', 'PIL', 'torch', 'os', 'io', 'sklearn', 'scipy', 'xml', 'chess', 'time', 'numpy', 'yahoo_finance', 'csv', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'unicodedata', 'fractions', 'queue', 'datetime', 'collections']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['PyPDF2', 'json', 'itertools', 'random', 'zipfile', 'requests', 're', 'pydub', 'math', 'stat', 'pandas', 'sympy', 'pubchempy', 'pptx', 'Bio', 'PIL', 'torch', 'os', 'io', 'sklearn', 'scipy', 'xml', 'chess', 'time', 'numpy', 'yahoo_finance', 'csv', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'unicodedata', 'fractions', 'queue', 'datetime', 'collections']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['PyPDF2', 'json', 'itertools', 'random', 'zipfile', 'requests', 're', 'pydub', 'math', 'stat', 'pandas', 'sympy', 'pubchempy', 'pptx', 'Bio', 'PIL', 'torch', 'os', 'io', 'sklearn', 'scipy', 'xml', 'chess', 'time', 'numpy', 'yahoo_finance', 'csv', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'unicodedata', 'fractions', 'queue', 'datetime', 'collections']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['PyPDF2', 'json', 'itertools', 'random', 'zipfile', 'requests', 're', 'pydub', 'math', 'stat', 'pandas', 'sympy', 'pubchempy', 'pptx', 'Bio', 'PIL', 'torch', 'os', 'io', 'sklearn', 'scipy', 'xml', 'chess', 'time', 'numpy', 'yahoo_finance', 'csv', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'unicodedata', 'fractions', 'queue', 'datetime', 'collections']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The Biopython library in Python must be used to solve the problem.  \n\u2022 The target protein has the PDB ID \u201c5wb7\u201d from the RCSB Protein Data Bank.  \n\u2022 The task requires parsing a PDB file and computing the distance between the first and second atoms as they appear in the file.  \n\u2022 The computed distance must be reported in Angstroms, with the value rounded to the nearest picometer.  \n\u2022 An attached file is provided and should be used:  \n\u2003\u2003- Attached file: data/gaia/validation/7dd30055-0198-452e-8c25-f73dbe27dcb8.pdb  \n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Documentation for Biopython\u2019s PDB parser (module Bio.PDB) and how it reads PDB files \u2013 available from the official Biopython documentation website.  \n\u2022 Details on how atom records are structured in a PDB file to correctly determine the order of atoms \u2013 can be found on the RCSB PDB website or in introductory materials on the PDB format.  \n\u2022 Conversion details between Angstroms and picometers (to understand the rounding precision), specifically that 1 Angstrom equals 100 picometers \u2013 available on reliable scientific resources or conversion reference websites.  \n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) of the first and second atoms from the parsed PDB file.  \n\u2022 The Euclidean distance between these two atoms using the formula \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2 + (z2 - z1)\u00b2].  \n\u2022 The rounded distance in Angstroms where the rounding is done to the nearest picometer (i.e. to the nearest 0.01 Angstrom given that 1 Angstrom = 100 picometers).\n```",
