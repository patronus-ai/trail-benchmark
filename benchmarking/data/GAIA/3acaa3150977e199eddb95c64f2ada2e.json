Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nI conducted multiple searches using variations of keywords such as \"L1vXCYZAYYM bird species analysis\", \"bird species moment timestamp\", and similar terms. The searches returned several unrelated results (e.g., general bird species information on Wikipedia, unrelated Quora discussions, etc.) but none that provided a focused analysis of the moment in the video where the maximum number of bird species are shown simultaneously. In particular, there was no analysis that included a reliable timestamp or confirmed count of different bird species in that portion of the video. As a result, I could not verify or extract the specific details required (the exact number of bird species and the exact timestamp) from any authoritative or credible reference.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nGiven the lack of available external references or detailed analyses, it may be necessary to perform a manual inspection of the video, such as by reviewing the timeline or consulting a birding expert or community who might have dissected the video in detail.

DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'itertools', 'io', 'datetime', 'unicodedata', 'torch', 'collections', 'math', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'chess', 'time', 'pubchempy', 'numpy', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'PIL', 'pydub', 'Bio', 'bs4', 'sympy', 'statistics', 're', 'requests', 'os', 'random', 'pptx', 'csv', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'json']\\n9.

Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The exact moment (timestamp) in the video when the maximum number of different bird species appear on camera simultaneously.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: From reviewing the video, we can logically derive which segment has the most variety of bird species.\\n\\n\u2022 The count of different bird species at that moment.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: After identifying the relevant segment, a frame-by-frame or thorough visual audit (or using captions or labels provided in the video) will help compute the specific number required for the answer.\\n\\n\u2022 Verification of the count through potentially cross-checking with any provided text or on-screen hints within the video.  \\n\u2002 Reasoning: It is necessary to confirm that the derived number is accurate and agrees with any embedded information to ensure that we provide the correct answer.\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'itertools', 'io', 'datetime', 'unicodedata', 'torch', 'collections', 'math', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'chess', 'time', 'pubchempy', 'numpy', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'PIL', 'pydub', 'Bio', 'bs4', 'sympy', 'statistics', 're', 'requests', 'os', 'random', 'pptx', 'csv', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'json']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The question asks: \u201cIn the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM, what is the highest number of bird species to be on camera simultaneously?\u201d  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This fact tells us exactly what to answer by specifying the required count (a number) and the context (a particular YouTube video).\n\n\u2022 The task statement asserts that all relevant tools are available, and success is mandatory.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: This guides us that we are expected to use any means (e.g., checking the video details, running verification steps) to reach the correct answer.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The content of the video from the provided link.  \n\u2002 Where to find: The YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: To answer, we must investigate the video\u2019s visual content to determine when the highest number of bird species appears simultaneously.\n\n\u2022 Specific timestamps or sections in the video where multiple bird species are visible.  \n\u2002 Where to find: Either by watching the video manually or by checking an available transcript or detailed description if provided on the YouTube page or in additional resources mentioned in the video.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Identifying the precise moment is necessary to count the bird species accurately.\n\n\u2022 Any supplementary information or official description accompanying the video that might clarify or list the bird species or highlight the counting moment.  \n\u2002 Where to find: The video description or linked resources on the YouTube page.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: Such information might provide hints or confirmation of the correct number without a full manual count.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The exact moment (timestamp) in the video when the maximum number of different bird species appear on camera simultaneously.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: From reviewing the video, we can logically derive which segment has the most variety of bird species.\n\n\u2022 The count of different bird species at that moment.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: After identifying the relevant segment, a frame-by-frame or thorough visual audit (or using captions or labels provided in the video) will help compute the specific number required for the answer.\n\n\u2022 Verification of the count through potentially cross-checking with any provided text or on-screen hints within the video.  \n\u2002 Reasoning: It is necessary to confirm that the derived number is accurate and agrees with any embedded information to ensure that we provide the correct answer.\n```",

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 A specific YouTube video is provided with the URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The video is the primary source for the task; all analysis is based on its contents.  \n\u2022 The task focuses on the moment in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: This defines the specific part of the video to study, narrowing the search.  \n\u2022 The desired outcome is to determine exactly how many different bird species appear at that moment, along with reliable references and the timestamp.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The number, timestamp, and supporting references are the key data points needed for a comprehensive answer.  \n\u2022 The agent's role is identified as \"search_agent\", and the task is submitted by a manager.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: This contextual information indicates the need for thorough and well-documented evidence.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Analyses or discussions on the provided YouTube video, specifically concerning the moment with the maximum number of bird species shown simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Search engines (Google, Bing), relevant birding forums, social media posts, expert reviews, and possibly YouTube comments or pinned messages that provide analysis details.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: To collect external analyses and discussions that report on this specific moment to ensure the information is cross-verified and reliable.  \n\u2022 The exact timestamp or time range in the video where the maximum number of bird species appear.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Check the video (using YouTube\u2019s timeline, video description, or searchable transcript) or look for mentions in discussions or articles about the video.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The timestamp is crucial to pinpoint the exact moment being referenced.  \n\u2022 The count of different bird species at that moment, as reported by reliable sources (including the possibility of multiple sources for cross-checking the data).  \n\u2003 Where/how: Same sources as above (search results, birding websites, or accompanying analytical content).  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The distinct number needs validation from reputable external references.  \n\u2022 Reliable reference materials (such as website links, articles, or expert reviews) that discuss this particular segment of the video.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Investigate birdwatching blogs, ornithological society pages, or media outlets known for verifying such content, as well as academic or discussion platforms like Reddit\u2019s birding communities.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: To support the claim with verifiable sources the manager can trust.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The exact number of different bird species present at the identified moment in the video.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Using the gathered analyses and reliable discussions, deduce a single, well-supported number.  \n\u2022 The precise timestamp in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Analyzing the video content and/or external discussions should allow derivation of the specific moment in the video.  \n\u2022 A compilation of reliable references and a brief synthesis of their credibility, ensuring that the derived number is correct and well-supported.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Cross-verification among multiple reliable sources will be needed to confirm the accuracy of both the species count and the timestamp.  \n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 A specific YouTube video is provided with the URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The video is the primary source for the task; all analysis is based on its contents.  \n\u2022 The task focuses on the moment in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: This defines the specific part of the video to study, narrowing the search.  \n\u2022 The desired outcome is to determine exactly how many different bird species appear at that moment, along with reliable references and the timestamp.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The number, timestamp, and supporting references are the key data points needed for a comprehensive answer.  \n\u2022 The agent's role is identified as \"search_agent\", and the task is submitted by a manager.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: This contextual information indicates the need for thorough and well-documented evidence.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Analyses or discussions on the provided YouTube video, specifically concerning the moment with the maximum number of bird species shown simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Search engines (Google, Bing), relevant birding forums, social media posts, expert reviews, and possibly YouTube comments or pinned messages that provide analysis details.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: To collect external analyses and discussions that report on this specific moment to ensure the information is cross-verified and reliable.  \n\u2022 The exact timestamp or time range in the video where the maximum number of bird species appear.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Check the video (using YouTube\u2019s timeline, video description, or searchable transcript) or look for mentions in discussions or articles about the video.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The timestamp is crucial to pinpoint the exact moment being referenced.  \n\u2022 The count of different bird species at that moment, as reported by reliable sources (including the possibility of multiple sources for cross-checking the data).  \n\u2003 Where/how: Same sources as above (search results, birding websites, or accompanying analytical content).  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The distinct number needs validation from reputable external references.  \n\u2022 Reliable reference materials (such as website links, articles, or expert reviews) that discuss this particular segment of the video.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Investigate birdwatching blogs, ornithological society pages, or media outlets known for verifying such content, as well as academic or discussion platforms like Reddit\u2019s birding communities.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: To support the claim with verifiable sources the manager can trust.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The exact number of different bird species present at the identified moment in the video.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Using the gathered analyses and reliable discussions, deduce a single, well-supported number.  \n\u2022 The precise timestamp in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Analyzing the video content and/or external discussions should allow derivation of the specific moment in the video.  \n\u2022 A compilation of reliable references and a brief synthesis of their credibility, ensuring that the derived number is correct and well-supported.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Cross-verification among multiple reliable sources will be needed to confirm the accuracy of both the species count and the timestamp.  \n\n\n```",

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 A specific YouTube video is provided with the URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The video is the primary source for the task; all analysis is based on its contents.  \n\u2022 The task focuses on the moment in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: This defines the specific part of the video to study, narrowing the search.  \n\u2022 The desired outcome is to determine exactly how many different bird species appear at that moment, along with reliable references and the timestamp.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The number, timestamp, and supporting references are the key data points needed for a comprehensive answer.  \n\u2022 The agent's role is identified as \"search_agent\", and the task is submitted by a manager.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: This contextual information indicates the need for thorough and well-documented evidence.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Analyses or discussions on the provided YouTube video, specifically concerning the moment with the maximum number of bird species shown simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Search engines (Google, Bing), relevant birding forums, social media posts, expert reviews, and possibly YouTube comments or pinned messages that provide analysis details.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: To collect external analyses and discussions that report on this specific moment to ensure the information is cross-verified and reliable.  \n\u2022 The exact timestamp or time range in the video where the maximum number of bird species appear.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Check the video (using YouTube\u2019s timeline, video description, or searchable transcript) or look for mentions in discussions or articles about the video.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The timestamp is crucial to pinpoint the exact moment being referenced.  \n\u2022 The count of different bird species at that moment, as reported by reliable sources (including the possibility of multiple sources for cross-checking the data).  \n\u2003 Where/how: Same sources as above (search results, birding websites, or accompanying analytical content).  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The distinct number needs validation from reputable external references.  \n\u2022 Reliable reference materials (such as website links, articles, or expert reviews) that discuss this particular segment of the video.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Investigate birdwatching blogs, ornithological society pages, or media outlets known for verifying such content, as well as academic or discussion platforms like Reddit\u2019s birding communities.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: To support the claim with verifiable sources the manager can trust.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The exact number of different bird species present at the identified moment in the video.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Using the gathered analyses and reliable discussions, deduce a single, well-supported number.  \n\u2022 The precise timestamp in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Analyzing the video content and/or external discussions should allow derivation of the specific moment in the video.  \n\u2022 A compilation of reliable references and a brief synthesis of their credibility, ensuring that the derived number is correct and well-supported.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Cross-verification among multiple reliable sources will be needed to confirm the accuracy of both the species count and the timestamp.  \n\n\n```",

Facts to look up\\n\u2022 Analyses or discussions on the provided YouTube video, specifically concerning the moment with the maximum number of bird species shown simultaneously.  \\n\u2003 Where/how: Search engines (Google, Bing), relevant birding forums, social media posts, expert reviews, and possibly YouTube comments or pinned messages that provide analysis details.  \\n\u2003 Reasoning: To collect external analyses and discussions that report on this specific moment to ensure the information is cross-verified and reliable.  \\n\u2022 The exact timestamp or time range in the video where the maximum number of bird species appear.  \\n\u2003 Where/how: Check the video (using YouTube\u2019s timeline, video description, or searchable transcript) or look for mentions in discussions or articles about the video.  \\n\u2003 Reasoning: The timestamp is crucial to pinpoint the exact moment being referenced.  \\n\u2022 The count of different bird species at that moment, as reported by reliable sources (including the possibility of multiple sources for cross-checking the data).  \\n\u2003 Where/how: Same sources as above (search results, birding websites, or accompanying analytical content).  \\n\u2003 Reasoning: The distinct number needs validation from reputable external references.  \\n\u2022 Reliable reference materials (such as website links, articles, or expert reviews) that discuss this particular segment of the video.  \\n\u2003 Where/how: Investigate birdwatching blogs, ornithological society pages, or media outlets known for verifying such content, as well as academic or discussion platforms like Reddit\u2019s birding communities.  \\n\u2003 Reasoning: To support the claim with verifiable sources the manager can trust.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The exact number of different bird species present at the identified moment in the video.  \\n\u2003 Reasoning: Using the gathered analyses and reliable discussions, deduce a single, well-supported number.  \\n\u2022 The precise timestamp in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \\n\u2003 Reasoning: Analyzing the video content and/or external discussions should allow derivation of the specific moment in the video.  \\n\u2022 A compilation of reliable references and a brief synthesis of their credibility, ensuring that the derived number is correct and well-supported.  \\n\u2003 Reasoning: Cross-verification among multiple reliable sources will be needed to confirm the accuracy of both the species count and the timestamp.  \\n\\n\\n```\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"[PLAN]:\\nHere is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n1.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 A specific YouTube video is provided with the URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The video is the primary source for the task; all analysis is based on its contents.  \n\u2022 The task focuses on the moment in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: This defines the specific part of the video to study, narrowing the search.  \n\u2022 The desired outcome is to determine exactly how many different bird species appear at that moment, along with reliable references and the timestamp.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The number, timestamp, and supporting references are the key data points needed for a comprehensive answer.  \n\u2022 The agent's role is identified as \"search_agent\", and the task is submitted by a manager.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: This contextual information indicates the need for thorough and well-documented evidence.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Analyses or discussions on the provided YouTube video, specifically concerning the moment with the maximum number of bird species shown simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Search engines (Google, Bing), relevant birding forums, social media posts, expert reviews, and possibly YouTube comments or pinned messages that provide analysis details.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: To collect external analyses and discussions that report on this specific moment to ensure the information is cross-verified and reliable.  \n\u2022 The exact timestamp or time range in the video where the maximum number of bird species appear.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Check the video (using YouTube\u2019s timeline, video description, or searchable transcript) or look for mentions in discussions or articles about the video.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The timestamp is crucial to pinpoint the exact moment being referenced.  \n\u2022 The count of different bird species at that moment, as reported by reliable sources (including the possibility of multiple sources for cross-checking the data).  \n\u2003 Where/how: Same sources as above (search results, birding websites, or accompanying analytical content).  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The distinct number needs validation from reputable external references.  \n\u2022 Reliable reference materials (such as website links, articles, or expert reviews) that discuss this particular segment of the video.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Investigate birdwatching blogs, ornithological society pages, or media outlets known for verifying such content, as well as academic or discussion platforms like Reddit\u2019s birding communities.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: To support the claim with verifiable sources the manager can trust.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The exact number of different bird species present at the identified moment in the video.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Using the gathered analyses and reliable discussions, deduce a single, well-supported number.  \n\u2022 The precise timestamp in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Analyzing the video content and/or external discussions should allow derivation of the specific moment in the video.  \n\u2022 A compilation of reliable references and a brief synthesis of their credibility, ensuring that the derived number is correct and well-supported.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Cross-verification among multiple reliable sources will be needed to confirm the accuracy of both the species count and the timestamp.  \n\n\n```",

Extract any information about the timestamp and the number of bird species from identified reliable references (such as ornithological blogs, birdwatching forums, or comments by verified experts).\\n5.

Begin by performing a broad web search using generic yet relevant keywords (e.g., \"L1vXCYZAYYM bird species analysis\", \"youtube bird species moment\", etc.) to locate any reputable analyses or discussions regarding the video.\n2. If initial searches yield potential sources, review these results to identify any specific mentions of the moment with the maximum bird species, noting timestamps and the reported species count.\n3. If web search challenges persist, visit the YouTube video page (or transcript) to manually search for keywords like \"bird\", \"species\", \"max\", or similar indicators that could highlight the moment in question.\n4. Extract any information about the timestamp and the number of bird species from identified reliable references (such as ornithological blogs, birdwatching forums, or comments by verified experts).\n5. Cross-check findings among multiple sources to validate the exact number of species and confirm the accurate timestamp.\n6. Compile the final answer with (a) a concise summary, (b) an extremely detailed explanation including timestamps and source references, and (c) any additional relevant context or caveats.\n7. If no conclusive external references are found, report the current research status and request further clarification from the manager, detailing the steps taken and findings gathered so far.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 A specific YouTube video is provided with the URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The video is the primary source for the task; all analysis is based on its contents.  \n\u2022 The task focuses on the moment in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: This defines the specific part of the video to study, narrowing the search.  \n\u2022 The desired outcome is to determine exactly how many different bird species appear at that moment, along with reliable references and the timestamp.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The number, timestamp, and supporting references are the key data points needed for a comprehensive answer.  \n\u2022 The agent's role is identified as \"search_agent\", and the task is submitted by a manager.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: This contextual information indicates the need for thorough and well-documented evidence.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 Analyses or discussions on the provided YouTube video, specifically concerning the moment with the maximum number of bird species shown simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Search engines (Google, Bing), relevant birding forums, social media posts, expert reviews, and possibly YouTube comments or pinned messages that provide analysis details.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: To collect external analyses and discussions that report on this specific moment to ensure the information is cross-verified and reliable.  \n\u2022 The exact timestamp or time range in the video where the maximum number of bird species appear.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Check the video (using YouTube\u2019s timeline, video description, or searchable transcript) or look for mentions in discussions or articles about the video.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The timestamp is crucial to pinpoint the exact moment being referenced.  \n\u2022 The count of different bird species at that moment, as reported by reliable sources (including the possibility of multiple sources for cross-checking the data).  \n\u2003 Where/how: Same sources as above (search results, birding websites, or accompanying analytical content).  \n\u2003 Reasoning: The distinct number needs validation from reputable external references.  \n\u2022 Reliable reference materials (such as website links, articles, or expert reviews) that discuss this particular segment of the video.  \n\u2003 Where/how: Investigate birdwatching blogs, ornithological society pages, or media outlets known for verifying such content, as well as academic or discussion platforms like Reddit\u2019s birding communities.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: To support the claim with verifiable sources the manager can trust.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The exact number of different bird species present at the identified moment in the video.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Using the gathered analyses and reliable discussions, deduce a single, well-supported number.  \n\u2022 The precise timestamp in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Analyzing the video content and/or external discussions should allow derivation of the specific moment in the video.  \n\u2022 A compilation of reliable references and a brief synthesis of their credibility, ensuring that the derived number is correct and well-supported.  \n\u2003 Reasoning: Cross-verification among multiple reliable sources will be needed to confirm the accuracy of both the species count and the timestamp.  \n\n\n```",

Additional context (if relevant):\\nGiven the lack of available external references or detailed analyses, it may be necessary to perform a manual inspection of the video, such as by reviewing the timeline or consulting a birding expert or community who might have dissected the video in detail.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'itertools', 'io', 'datetime', 'unicodedata', 'torch', 'collections', 'math', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'chess', 'time', 'pubchempy', 'numpy', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'PIL', 'pydub', 'Bio', 'bs4', 'sympy', 'statistics', 're', 'requests', 'os', 'random', 'pptx', 'csv', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'json']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'itertools', 'io', 'datetime', 'unicodedata', 'torch', 'collections', 'math', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'chess', 'time', 'pubchempy', 'numpy', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'PIL', 'pydub', 'Bio', 'bs4', 'sympy', 'statistics', 're', 'requests', 'os', 'random', 'pptx', 'csv', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'json']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Facts that we have learned:\\n     \u2022 Initial web searches with specific queries related to \u201cL1vXCYZAYYM\u201d and phrases like \u201cmaximum number of bird species,\u201d \u201canalysis,\u201d or \u201ctimestamp\u201d did not yield direct, relevant analysis or discussions about the target moment.\\n     \u2022 Some search results surfaced unrelated content (e.g., general bird species information from Wikipedia or unrelated topics on Quora and TikTok), indicating that the specific analysis on this video segment is not prominently indexed or discussed under those search terms.\\n\\n  3. Facts still to look up:\\n     \u2022 Detailed analyses, articles, forum discussions, or expert reviews that specifically discuss the video segment in question, including any identified timestamp and the count of different bird species shown.\\n     \u2022 References from authoritative or reliable birdwatching or ornithological sources (e.g., birding blogs, research communities, or verified media reviews) that have examined this video segment.\\n     \u2022 Information that can confirm the reliability of the reported timestamp and species count.\\n\\n  4. Facts still to derive:\\n     \u2022 The exact number of different bird species that appear simultaneously at the identified moment in the video.\\n     \u2022 The precise timestamp (or a narrow time range) in the video at which this maximum number of bird species is displayed.\\n     \u2022 A synthesized conclusion based on any cross-referenced data from multiple sources to confirm the correctness of the count and timestamp.\\n\\nThis updated list of facts reflects our current understanding and outlines both what remains to be searched online and what we need to ultimately derive from that research.\\n```'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Calling tools:\\n[{\\'id\\': \\'call_3TGIVwvDbSRrERZ0NsutPn9j\\', \\'type\\': \\'function\\', \\'function\\': {\\'name\\': \\'final_answer\\', \\'arguments\\': {\\'answer\\': \\'### 1. Task outcome (short version):\\\\nNo reliable analyses or discussions were found that specify the exact moment in the video when the maximum number of bird species appear, nor any clear references with a species count or timestamp.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nI conducted multiple searches using variations of keywords such as \"L1vXCYZAYYM bird species analysis\", \"bird species moment timestamp\", and similar terms. The searches returned several unrelated results (e.g., general bird species information on Wikipedia, unrelated Quora discussions, etc.) but none that provided a focused analysis of the moment in the video where the maximum number of bird species are shown simultaneously. In particular, there was no analysis that included a reliable timestamp or confirmed count of different bird species in that portion of the video. As a result, I could not verify or extract the specific details required (the exact number of bird species and the exact timestamp) from any authoritative or credible reference.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nGiven the lack of available external references or detailed analyses, it may be necessary to perform a manual inspection of the video, such as by reviewing the timeline or consulting a birding expert or community who might have dissected the video in detail. Further clarification from the manager about whether to seek direct verification through manual review or alternative sources might also be warranted.\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",

In particular, there was no analysis that included a reliable timestamp or confirmed count of different bird species in that portion of the video. As a result, I could not verify or extract the specific details required (the exact number of bird species and the exact timestamp) from any authoritative or credible reference.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nGiven the lack of available external references or detailed analyses, it may be necessary to perform a manual inspection of the video, such as by reviewing the timeline or consulting a birding expert or community who might have dissected the video in detail. Further clarification from the manager about whether to seek direct verification through manual review or alternative sources might also be warranted.\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\nPlease search for analyses or discussions on the YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM, specifically looking for the moment in the video where the maximum number of bird species are shown on camera simultaneously.

Facts given in the task\\n\u2022 A specific YouTube video is provided with the URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.  \\n\\u2003 Reasoning: The video is the primary source for the task; all analysis is based on its contents.  \\n\u2022 The task focuses on the moment in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \\n\\u2003 Reasoning: This defines the specific part of the video to study, narrowing the search.  \\n\u2022 The desired outcome is to determine exactly how many different bird species appear at that moment, along with reliable references and the timestamp.  \\n\\u2003 Reasoning: The number, timestamp, and supporting references are the key data points needed for a comprehensive answer.  \\n\u2022 The agent\\'s role is identified as \"search_agent\", and the task is submitted by a manager.  \\n\\u2003 Reasoning: This contextual information indicates the need for thorough and well-documented evidence.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n\u2022 Analyses or discussions on the provided YouTube video, specifically concerning the moment with the maximum number of bird species shown simultaneously.  \\n\\u2003 Where/how: Search engines (Google, Bing), relevant birding forums, social media posts, expert reviews, and possibly YouTube comments or pinned messages that provide analysis details.  \\n\\u2003 Reasoning: To collect external analyses and discussions that report on this specific moment to ensure the information is cross-verified and reliable.  \\n\u2022 The exact timestamp or time range in the video where the maximum number of bird species appear.  \\n\\u2003 Where/how: Check the video (using YouTube\u2019s timeline, video description, or searchable transcript) or look for mentions in discussions or articles about the video.  \\n\\u2003 Reasoning: The timestamp is crucial to pinpoint the exact moment being referenced.  \\n\u2022 The count of different bird species at that moment, as reported by reliable sources (including the possibility of multiple sources for cross-checking the data).  \\n\\u2003 Where/how: Same sources as above (search results, birding websites, or accompanying analytical content).  \\n\\u2003 Reasoning: The distinct number needs validation from reputable external references.  \\n\u2022 Reliable reference materials (such as website links, articles, or expert reviews) that discuss this particular segment of the video.  \\n\\u2003 Where/how: Investigate birdwatching blogs, ornithological society pages, or media outlets known for verifying such content, as well as academic or discussion platforms like Reddit\u2019s birding communities.  \\n\\u2003 Reasoning: To support the claim with verifiable sources the manager can trust.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n\u2022 The exact number of different bird species present at the identified moment in the video.  \\n\\u2003 Reasoning: Using the gathered analyses and reliable discussions, deduce a single, well-supported number.  \\n\u2022 The precise timestamp in the video that shows the maximum number of bird species simultaneously.  \\n\\u2003 Reasoning: Analyzing the video content and/or external discussions should allow derivation of the specific moment in the video.  \\n\u2022 A compilation of reliable references and a brief synthesis of their credibility, ensuring that the derived number is correct and well-supported.  \\n\\u2003 Reasoning: Cross-verification among multiple reliable sources will be needed to confirm the accuracy of both the species count and the timestamp.  \\n\\n\\n```'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Calling tools:\\n[{\\'id\\': \\'call_D6oBBVUnefhBLEI42jF46fFv\\', \\'type\\': \\'function\\', \\'function\\': {\\'name\\': \\'web_search\\', \\'arguments\\': {\\'query\\': \\'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM maximum number of bird species simultaneously analysis timestamp \"bird species count\"\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Call id: call_D6oBBVUnefhBLEI42jF46fFv\\nError:\\nError when executing tool web_search with arguments {\\'query\\': \\'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM maximum number of bird species simultaneously analysis timestamp \"bird species count\"\\'}: Exception: No results found for query: \\'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM maximum number of bird species simultaneously analysis timestamp \"bird species count\"\\'.
