Task outcome (short version):\nI was unable to locate the specific Season 4 test details from James\u2019s channel that mention the CFM numbers for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater. \n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nI began by searching for \u201cJames's channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d and related queries to identify content that might contain technical test data. The search results returned a YouTube playlist titled \u201cCHEATER BEATERS!\u201d from a channel called LUCKYY 10P and a video \"Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode\" from FilmRise Television. The latter appeared to be a reality TV episode concerning relationship issues and did not present technical CFM measurement details. Additionally, the playlist from LUCKYY 10P did not clearly indicate that it was from James\u2019s channel or that it contained the precise test information requested, particularly the CFM performance numbers of the two devices. I further attempted to scroll or locate the section with the relevant details using search techniques (Ctrl+F) on the provided content, but encountered either non-technical content or navigation issues. As a result, no clear evidence of specific CFM numbers (with the Cheater outperforming the Cheater Beater) was found.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nGiven the ambiguity in sources \u2013 the search results did not return a verified video or document coming directly from a channel identified as \"James\u2019s channel\" that includes technical tests for these devices \u2013 it seems that the necessary details (the exact CFM values) might either be in a different resource or may require additional context or clarification regarding the exact source or link to refer to.

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nI was unable to locate the specific Season 4 test details from James\u2019s channel that mention the CFM numbers for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater. \\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nI began by searching for \u201cJames\\\\\\'s channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d and related queries to identify content that might contain technical test data. The search results returned a YouTube playlist titled \u201cCHEATER BEATERS!\u201d from a channel called LUCKYY 10P and a video \"Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode\" from FilmRise Television. The latter appeared to be a reality TV episode concerning relationship issues and did not present technical CFM measurement details. Additionally, the playlist from LUCKYY 10P did not clearly indicate that it was from James\u2019s channel or that it contained the precise test information requested, particularly the CFM performance numbers of the two devices. I further attempted to scroll or locate the section with the relevant details using search techniques (Ctrl+F) on the provided content, but encountered either non-technical content or navigation issues. As a result, no clear evidence of specific CFM numbers (with the Cheater outperforming the Cheater Beater) was found.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nGiven the ambiguity in sources \u2013 the search results did not return a verified video or document coming directly from a channel identified as \"James\u2019s channel\" that includes technical tests for these devices \u2013 it seems that the necessary details (the exact CFM values) might either be in a different resource or may require additional context or clarification regarding the exact source or link to refer to. Please provide further clarification or a direct reference to the James\u2019s channel content containing these test details so I can assist further.\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 're', 'sympy', 'io', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'itertools', 'queue', 'statistics', 'xml', 'random', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'PyPDF2', 'time', 'yahoo_finance', 'os', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'chess', 'pydub', 'PIL', 'scipy', 'datetime', 'requests', 'csv', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'numpy', 'torch']\\n9.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 're', 'sympy', 'io', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'itertools', 'queue', 'statistics', 'xml', 'random', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'PyPDF2', 'time', 'yahoo_finance', 'os', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'chess', 'pydub', 'PIL', 'scipy', 'datetime', 'requests', 'csv', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'numpy', 'torch']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nI began by searching for \u201cJames's channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d and related queries to identify content that might contain technical test data. The search results returned a YouTube playlist titled \u201cCHEATER BEATERS!\u201d from a channel called LUCKYY 10P and a video \"Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode\" from FilmRise Television. The latter appeared to be a reality TV episode concerning relationship issues and did not present technical CFM measurement details. Additionally, the playlist from LUCKYY 10P did not clearly indicate that it was from James\u2019s channel or that it contained the precise test information requested, particularly the CFM performance numbers of the two devices. I further attempted to scroll or locate the section with the relevant details using search techniques (Ctrl+F) on the provided content, but encountered either non-technical content or navigation issues. As a result, no clear evidence of specific CFM numbers (with the Cheater outperforming the Cheater Beater) was found.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nGiven the ambiguity in sources \u2013 the search results did not return a verified video or document coming directly from a channel identified as \"James\u2019s channel\" that includes technical tests for these devices \u2013 it seems that the necessary details (the exact CFM values) might either be in a different resource or may require additional context or clarification regarding the exact source or link to refer to. Please provide further clarification or a direct reference to the James\u2019s channel content containing these test details so I can assist further.",

Use find_on_page_ctrl_f (or similar navigation techniques) to look for keywords like \u201cCFM\u201d, \u201cCheater\u201d, \u201cCheater Beater\u201d, and \u201cseason 4\u201d within the content.\n5. Extract the specific CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and for the Cheater Beater from the identified section.\n6. Verify that the extracted number for Cheater is greater than the number for Cheater Beater.\n7. Prepare the final answer in the required format that includes a short version summary, an extremely detailed explanation, and additional context if relevant.\n8. Use the final_answer tool to return the final result with the two CFM numbers formatted as \u201cCFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater.\u201d\n\n\n```",

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Extract the specific CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and for the Cheater Beater from the identified section.\n6. Verify that the extracted number for Cheater is greater than the number for Cheater Beater.\n7. Prepare the final answer in the required format that includes a short version summary, an extremely detailed explanation, and additional context if relevant.\n8.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task is to search for test details from season 4 on James\u2019s channel.  \n\u2002 - This specifies the source (James\u2019s channel) and the particular season (season 4) for the test details.  \n\u2022 Two specific devices are involved: the \u201cCheater\u201d and the \u201cCheater Beater.\u201d  \n\u2002 - Their performance, measured in CFM (cubic feet per minute), must be compared.  \n\u2022 The outcome should show that the Cheater outperformed the Cheater Beater, meaning its CFM number must be higher than that of the Cheater Beater.  \n\u2022 The final report should present the two CFM numbers in a format: \u201cCFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater.\u201d\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The specific test details (e.g., video or page) on James\u2019s channel for season 4 that contain the CFM performance numbers.  \n\u2002 - Where: By navigating to James\u2019s channel (likely on YouTube or an associated website) or any linked .txt, .pdf, or other files referenced in his content.  \n\u2022 The video or documentation timestamp or section that discusses the tests of the \u201cCheater\u201d and \u201cCheater Beater.\u201d  \n\u2002 - Where: Within season 4 content on James\u2019s channel.  \n\u2022 Verification or contextual information regarding the testing methodology for obtaining the CFM numbers.  \n\u2002 - Where: Possibly in the description or annotations of the season 4 test details on James\u2019s channel.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The individual CFM numbers for each device (Cheater and Cheater Beater) from the located source.  \n\u2002 - Derived by watching the content or reading the document that reports these measurements.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that the CFM value for the Cheater is higher than that for the Cheater Beater.  \n\u2002 - Derived by comparing the two numbers once obtained.  \n\u2022 The final reporting format which includes the two numbers in the specific order prescribed (\u201cCFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater\u201d).  \n\u2002 - Derived as a format requirement once the numbers are available.\n\n\n```",

Identify a candidate page or video from the search results that likely contains the season 4 test details for the Cheater and Cheater Beater.\n3. Use the visit_page tool on the selected result to retrieve the content and search for the segment where the CFM performance numbers are mentioned.\n4. Use find_on_page_ctrl_f (or similar navigation techniques) to look for keywords like \u201cCFM\u201d, \u201cCheater\u201d, \u201cCheater Beater\u201d, and \u201cseason 4\u201d within the content.\n5. Extract the specific CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and for the Cheater Beater from the identified section.\n6. Verify that the extracted number for Cheater is greater than the number for Cheater Beater.\n7. Prepare the final answer in the required format that includes a short version summary, an extremely detailed explanation, and additional context if relevant.\n8. Use the final_answer tool to return the final result with the two CFM numbers formatted as \u201cCFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater.\u201d\n\n\n```",

Facts that we have learned:\\n\u2022 A search with the query \u201cJames's channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d returned a YouTube playlist titled 'CHEATER BEATERS!' from LUCKYY 10P.  \\n\u2022 A second search with a slightly modified query (\u201cJames's channel season 4 test Cheater Cheater Beater CFM\u201d) yielded two results: one being the same playlist and another being a YouTube video titled 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' from FilmRise Television.  \\n\u2022 Accessing the 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' shows a reality TV episode focused on relationship infidelity, which does not appear to include technical test measurements for the devices in question.\\n\\n### 3.

Review the search results to identify a candidate video or document that originates from James\u2019s channel and relates to a Season 4 test comparing the Cheater and Cheater Beater.\\n3. Visit the identified candidate page using the visit_page tool to retrieve its content.\\n4.

Carefully extract the two CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater.\\n6. Verify that the CFM number for the Cheater is higher than the CFM number for the Cheater Beater.\\n7. Prepare a detailed final answer that includes: \\n   \u2022 A short task outcome summarizing the final results (the two CFM numbers in the required format). \\n   \u2022 An extremely detailed explanation of the steps taken and how the final numbers were obtained.\\n   \u2022 Any additional context or observations relevant to the technical details or testing methodology.\\n8.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Review the search results to identify a candidate video or document that originates from James\u2019s channel and relates to a Season 4 test comparing the Cheater and Cheater Beater.\\n3. Visit the identified candidate page using the visit_page tool to retrieve its content.\\n4. Use find_on_page_ctrl_f to search for keywords such as \u201cCFM\u201d, \u201cCheater\u201d, and \u201cCheater Beater\u201d within the content to pinpoint the section where the test details are reported.\\n5. Carefully extract the two CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater.\\n6. Verify that the CFM number for the Cheater is higher than the CFM number for the Cheater Beater.\\n7. Prepare a detailed final answer that includes: \\n   \u2022 A short task outcome summarizing the final results (the two CFM numbers in the required format). \\n   \u2022 An extremely detailed explanation of the steps taken and how the final numbers were obtained.\\n   \u2022 Any additional context or observations relevant to the technical details or testing methodology.\\n8.

Carefully extract the two CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater.\\n6. Verify that the CFM number for the Cheater is higher than the CFM number for the Cheater Beater.\\n7. Prepare a detailed final answer that includes: \\n   \u2022 A short task outcome summarizing the final results (the two CFM numbers in the required format). \\n   \u2022 An extremely detailed explanation of the steps taken and how the final numbers were obtained.\\n   \u2022 Any additional context or observations relevant to the technical details or testing methodology.\\n8.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Review the search results to identify a candidate video or document that originates from James\u2019s channel and relates to a Season 4 test comparing the Cheater and Cheater Beater.\n3. Visit the identified candidate page using the visit_page tool to retrieve its content.\n4. Use find_on_page_ctrl_f to search for keywords such as \u201cCFM\u201d, \u201cCheater\u201d, and \u201cCheater Beater\u201d within the content to pinpoint the section where the test details are reported.\n5. Carefully extract the two CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater.\n6. Verify that the CFM number for the Cheater is higher than the CFM number for the Cheater Beater.\n7. Prepare a detailed final answer that includes: \n   \u2022 A short task outcome summarizing the final results (the two CFM numbers in the required format). \n   \u2022 An extremely detailed explanation of the steps taken and how the final numbers were obtained.\n   \u2022 Any additional context or observations relevant to the technical details or testing methodology.\n8.

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task is to search for test details from season 4 on James\u2019s channel.  \n\u2002 - This specifies the source (James\u2019s channel) and the particular season (season 4) for the test details.  \n\u2022 Two specific devices are involved: the \u201cCheater\u201d and the \u201cCheater Beater.\u201d  \n\u2002 - Their performance, measured in CFM (cubic feet per minute), must be compared.  \n\u2022 The outcome should show that the Cheater outperformed the Cheater Beater, meaning its CFM number must be higher than that of the Cheater Beater.  \n\u2022 The final report should present the two CFM numbers in a format: \u201cCFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater.\u201d\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The specific test details (e.g., video or page) on James\u2019s channel for season 4 that contain the CFM performance numbers.  \n\u2002 - Where: By navigating to James\u2019s channel (likely on YouTube or an associated website) or any linked .txt, .pdf, or other files referenced in his content.  \n\u2022 The video or documentation timestamp or section that discusses the tests of the \u201cCheater\u201d and \u201cCheater Beater.\u201d  \n\u2002 - Where: Within season 4 content on James\u2019s channel.  \n\u2022 Verification or contextual information regarding the testing methodology for obtaining the CFM numbers.  \n\u2002 - Where: Possibly in the description or annotations of the season 4 test details on James\u2019s channel.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The individual CFM numbers for each device (Cheater and Cheater Beater) from the located source.  \n\u2002 - Derived by watching the content or reading the document that reports these measurements.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that the CFM value for the Cheater is higher than that for the Cheater Beater.  \n\u2002 - Derived by comparing the two numbers once obtained.  \n\u2022 The final reporting format which includes the two numbers in the specific order prescribed (\u201cCFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater\u201d).  \n\u2002 - Derived as a format requirement once the numbers are available.\n\n\n```",

Use the web_search tool with a query focused on \u201cJames\u2019s channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d to locate the relevant video or webpage containing the test details.\n2. Identify a candidate page or video from the search results that likely contains the season 4 test details for the Cheater and Cheater Beater.\n3. Use the visit_page tool on the selected result to retrieve the content and search for the segment where the CFM performance numbers are mentioned.\n4. Use find_on_page_ctrl_f (or similar navigation techniques) to look for keywords like \u201cCFM\u201d, \u201cCheater\u201d, \u201cCheater Beater\u201d, and \u201cseason 4\u201d within the content.\n5. Extract the specific CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and for the Cheater Beater from the identified section.\n6. Verify that the extracted number for Cheater is greater than the number for Cheater Beater.\n7. Prepare the final answer in the required format that includes a short version summary, an extremely detailed explanation, and additional context if relevant.\n8. Use the final_answer tool to return the final result with the two CFM numbers formatted as \u201cCFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater.\u201d\n\n\n```",

Review the search results to identify a candidate video or document that originates from James\u2019s channel and relates to a Season 4 test comparing the Cheater and Cheater Beater.\\n3. Visit the identified candidate page using the visit_page tool to retrieve its content.\\n4.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4.

Facts given in the task:\n\u2022 In James\u2019s channel\u2019s Season 4, there is a segment containing test details on two devices: the 'Cheater' and the 'Cheater Beater'.  \n\u2022 The devices\u2019 performance is measured in CFM (cubic feet per minute).  \n\u2022 The required outcome is to confirm that the Cheater outperformed the Cheater Beater (i.e., its CFM number is higher).  \n\u2022 The final answer must list the two numbers in the format: 'CFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater'.\n\n### 2. Facts that we have learned:\n\u2022 A search with the query \u201cJames's channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d returned a YouTube playlist titled 'CHEATER BEATERS!' from LUCKYY 10P.  \n\u2022 A second search with a slightly modified query (\u201cJames's channel season 4 test Cheater Cheater Beater CFM\u201d) yielded two results: one being the same playlist and another being a YouTube video titled 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' from FilmRise Television.  \n\u2022 Accessing the 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' shows a reality TV episode focused on relationship infidelity, which does not appear to include technical test measurements for the devices in question.\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up:\n\u2022 The specific source (video, webpage, or document) on James\u2019s channel that contains the Season 4 test details for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater with their respective CFM numbers.  \n\u2022 The exact location (timestamp, description, or on-screen info) where the test is presented and the CFM numbers are mentioned.  \n\u2022 Verification of the testing methodology and context in which the CFM numbers were measured on James\u2019s channel.\n\n### 4. Facts still to derive:\n\u2022 The specific CFM number for the Cheater device as reported in the test.  \n\u2022 The specific CFM number for the Cheater Beater device as reported in the test.  \n\u2022 Confirmation (by comparing the two derived numbers) that the Cheater\u2019s CFM is indeed greater than the Cheater Beater\u2019s CFM.\n\"\n```",

Facts given in the task\n\u2022 The task is to search for test details from season 4 on James\u2019s channel.  \n\u2002 - This specifies the source (James\u2019s channel) and the particular season (season 4) for the test details.  \n\u2022 Two specific devices are involved: the \u201cCheater\u201d and the \u201cCheater Beater.\u201d  \n\u2002 - Their performance, measured in CFM (cubic feet per minute), must be compared.  \n\u2022 The outcome should show that the Cheater outperformed the Cheater Beater, meaning its CFM number must be higher than that of the Cheater Beater.  \n\u2022 The final report should present the two CFM numbers in a format: \u201cCFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater.\u201d\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n\u2022 The specific test details (e.g., video or page) on James\u2019s channel for season 4 that contain the CFM performance numbers.  \n\u2002 - Where: By navigating to James\u2019s channel (likely on YouTube or an associated website) or any linked .txt, .pdf, or other files referenced in his content.  \n\u2022 The video or documentation timestamp or section that discusses the tests of the \u201cCheater\u201d and \u201cCheater Beater.\u201d  \n\u2002 - Where: Within season 4 content on James\u2019s channel.  \n\u2022 Verification or contextual information regarding the testing methodology for obtaining the CFM numbers.  \n\u2002 - Where: Possibly in the description or annotations of the season 4 test details on James\u2019s channel.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n\u2022 The individual CFM numbers for each device (Cheater and Cheater Beater) from the located source.  \n\u2002 - Derived by watching the content or reading the document that reports these measurements.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that the CFM value for the Cheater is higher than that for the Cheater Beater.  \n\u2002 - Derived by comparing the two numbers once obtained.  \n\u2022 The final reporting format which includes the two numbers in the specific order prescribed (\u201cCFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater\u201d).  \n\u2002 - Derived as a format requirement once the numbers are available.\n\n\n```",

Facts given in the task:\\n\u2022 In James\u2019s channel\u2019s Season 4, there is a segment containing test details on two devices: the 'Cheater' and the 'Cheater Beater'.  \\n\u2022 The devices\u2019 performance is measured in CFM (cubic feet per minute).  \\n\u2022 The required outcome is to confirm that the Cheater outperformed the Cheater Beater (i.e., its CFM number is higher).  \\n\u2022 The final answer must list the two numbers in the format: 'CFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater'.\\n\\n### 2. Facts that we have learned:\\n\u2022 A search with the query \u201cJames's channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d returned a YouTube playlist titled 'CHEATER BEATERS!' from LUCKYY 10P.  \\n\u2022 A second search with a slightly modified query (\u201cJames's channel season 4 test Cheater Cheater Beater CFM\u201d) yielded two results: one being the same playlist and another being a YouTube video titled 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' from FilmRise Television.  \\n\u2022 Accessing the 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' shows a reality TV episode focused on relationship infidelity, which does not appear to include technical test measurements for the devices in question.\\n\\n### 3. Facts still to look up:\\n\u2022 The specific source (video, webpage, or document) on James\u2019s channel that contains the Season 4 test details for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater with their respective CFM numbers.  \\n\u2022 The exact location (timestamp, description, or on-screen info) where the test is presented and the CFM numbers are mentioned.  \\n\u2022 Verification of the testing methodology and context in which the CFM numbers were measured on James\u2019s channel.\\n\\n### 4.

Review the search results to identify a candidate video or document that originates from James\u2019s channel and relates to a Season 4 test comparing the Cheater and Cheater Beater.\\n3. Visit the identified candidate page using the visit_page tool to retrieve its content.\\n4. Use find_on_page_ctrl_f to search for keywords such as \u201cCFM\u201d, \u201cCheater\u201d, and \u201cCheater Beater\u201d within the content to pinpoint the section where the test details are reported.\\n5. Carefully extract the two CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater.\\n6. Verify that the CFM number for the Cheater is higher than the CFM number for the Cheater Beater.\\n7. Prepare a detailed final answer that includes: \\n   \u2022 A short task outcome summarizing the final results (the two CFM numbers in the required format). \\n   \u2022 An extremely detailed explanation of the steps taken and how the final numbers were obtained.\\n   \u2022 Any additional context or observations relevant to the technical details or testing methodology.\\n8.

Facts given in the task:\n\u2022 In James\u2019s channel\u2019s Season 4, there is a segment containing test details on two devices: the 'Cheater' and the 'Cheater Beater'.  \n\u2022 The devices\u2019 performance is measured in CFM (cubic feet per minute).  \n\u2022 The required outcome is to confirm that the Cheater outperformed the Cheater Beater (i.e., its CFM number is higher).  \n\u2022 The final answer must list the two numbers in the format: 'CFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater'.\n\n### 2. Facts that we have learned:\n\u2022 A search with the query \u201cJames's channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d returned a YouTube playlist titled 'CHEATER BEATERS!' from LUCKYY 10P.  \n\u2022 A second search with a slightly modified query (\u201cJames's channel season 4 test Cheater Cheater Beater CFM\u201d) yielded two results: one being the same playlist and another being a YouTube video titled 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' from FilmRise Television.  \n\u2022 Accessing the 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' shows a reality TV episode focused on relationship infidelity, which does not appear to include technical test measurements for the devices in question.\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up:\n\u2022 The specific source (video, webpage, or document) on James\u2019s channel that contains the Season 4 test details for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater with their respective CFM numbers.  \n\u2022 The exact location (timestamp, description, or on-screen info) where the test is presented and the CFM numbers are mentioned.  \n\u2022 Verification of the testing methodology and context in which the CFM numbers were measured on James\u2019s channel.\n\n### 4. Facts still to derive:\n\u2022 The specific CFM number for the Cheater device as reported in the test.  \n\u2022 The specific CFM number for the Cheater Beater device as reported in the test.  \n\u2022 Confirmation (by comparing the two derived numbers) that the Cheater\u2019s CFM is indeed greater than the Cheater Beater\u2019s CFM.\n\"\n```",

Carefully extract the two CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater.\n6. Verify that the CFM number for the Cheater is higher than the CFM number for the Cheater Beater.\n7. Prepare a detailed final answer that includes: \n   \u2022 A short task outcome summarizing the final results (the two CFM numbers in the required format). \n   \u2022 An extremely detailed explanation of the steps taken and how the final numbers were obtained.\n   \u2022 Any additional context or observations relevant to the technical details or testing methodology.\n8.

Facts given in the task:\n\u2022 In James\u2019s channel\u2019s Season 4, there is a segment containing test details on two devices: the 'Cheater' and the 'Cheater Beater'.  \n\u2022 The devices\u2019 performance is measured in CFM (cubic feet per minute).  \n\u2022 The required outcome is to confirm that the Cheater outperformed the Cheater Beater (i.e., its CFM number is higher).  \n\u2022 The final answer must list the two numbers in the format: 'CFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater'.\n\n### 2. Facts that we have learned:\n\u2022 A search with the query \u201cJames's channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d returned a YouTube playlist titled 'CHEATER BEATERS!' from LUCKYY 10P.  \n\u2022 A second search with a slightly modified query (\u201cJames's channel season 4 test Cheater Cheater Beater CFM\u201d) yielded two results: one being the same playlist and another being a YouTube video titled 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' from FilmRise Television.  \n\u2022 Accessing the 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' shows a reality TV episode focused on relationship infidelity, which does not appear to include technical test measurements for the devices in question.\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up:\n\u2022 The specific source (video, webpage, or document) on James\u2019s channel that contains the Season 4 test details for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater with their respective CFM numbers.  \n\u2022 The exact location (timestamp, description, or on-screen info) where the test is presented and the CFM numbers are mentioned.  \n\u2022 Verification of the testing methodology and context in which the CFM numbers were measured on James\u2019s channel.\n\n### 4. Facts still to derive:\n\u2022 The specific CFM number for the Cheater device as reported in the test.  \n\u2022 The specific CFM number for the Cheater Beater device as reported in the test.  \n\u2022 Confirmation (by comparing the two derived numbers) that the Cheater\u2019s CFM is indeed greater than the Cheater Beater\u2019s CFM.\n\"\n```",

Carefully extract the two CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater.\n6. Verify that the CFM number for the Cheater is higher than the CFM number for the Cheater Beater.\n7. Prepare a detailed final answer that includes: \n   \u2022 A short task outcome summarizing the final results (the two CFM numbers in the required format). \n   \u2022 An extremely detailed explanation of the steps taken and how the final numbers were obtained.\n   \u2022 Any additional context or observations relevant to the technical details or testing methodology.\n8.

Facts still to derive:\n\u2022 The specific CFM number reported for the Cheater.\n\u2022 The specific CFM number reported for the Cheater Beater.\n\u2022 Verification that the Cheater\u2019s CFM is indeed higher than the Cheater Beater\u2019s CFM, as required by the task.\n\u2022 Consolidation of these numbers into the final reporting format: \u201cCFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater.\u201d\n\nThis is our current state of knowledge and what remains to be confirmed.\n```\n\nNow for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\nBeware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps.

Extract the specific CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and for the Cheater Beater from the identified section.\n6. Verify that the extracted number for Cheater is greater than the number for Cheater Beater.\n7. Prepare the final answer in the required format that includes a short version summary, an extremely detailed explanation, and additional context if relevant.\n8.

Facts given in the task:\n\u2022 In James\u2019s channel\u2019s Season 4, there is a segment containing test details on two devices: the 'Cheater' and the 'Cheater Beater'.  \n\u2022 The devices\u2019 performance is measured in CFM (cubic feet per minute).  \n\u2022 The required outcome is to confirm that the Cheater outperformed the Cheater Beater (i.e., its CFM number is higher).  \n\u2022 The final answer must list the two numbers in the format: 'CFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater'.\n\n### 2. Facts that we have learned:\n\u2022 A search with the query \u201cJames's channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d returned a YouTube playlist titled 'CHEATER BEATERS!' from LUCKYY 10P.  \n\u2022 A second search with a slightly modified query (\u201cJames's channel season 4 test Cheater Cheater Beater CFM\u201d) yielded two results: one being the same playlist and another being a YouTube video titled 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' from FilmRise Television.  \n\u2022 Accessing the 'Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode' shows a reality TV episode focused on relationship infidelity, which does not appear to include technical test measurements for the devices in question.\n\n### 3. Facts still to look up:\n\u2022 The specific source (video, webpage, or document) on James\u2019s channel that contains the Season 4 test details for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater with their respective CFM numbers.  \n\u2022 The exact location (timestamp, description, or on-screen info) where the test is presented and the CFM numbers are mentioned.  \n\u2022 Verification of the testing methodology and context in which the CFM numbers were measured on James\u2019s channel.\n\n### 4. Facts still to derive:\n\u2022 The specific CFM number for the Cheater device as reported in the test.  \n\u2022 The specific CFM number for the Cheater Beater device as reported in the test.  \n\u2022 Confirmation (by comparing the two derived numbers) that the Cheater\u2019s CFM is indeed greater than the Cheater Beater\u2019s CFM.\n\"\n```",

Carefully extract the two CFM numbers reported for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater.\n6. Verify that the CFM number for the Cheater is higher than the CFM number for the Cheater Beater.\n7. Prepare a detailed final answer that includes: \n   \u2022 A short task outcome summarizing the final results (the two CFM numbers in the required format). \n   \u2022 An extremely detailed explanation of the steps taken and how the final numbers were obtained.\n   \u2022 Any additional context or observations relevant to the technical details or testing methodology.\n8.

DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 're', 'sympy', 'io', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'itertools', 'queue', 'statistics', 'xml', 'random', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'PyPDF2', 'time', 'yahoo_finance', 'os', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'chess', 'pydub', 'PIL', 'scipy', 'datetime', 'requests', 'csv', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'numpy', 'torch']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Additionally, the playlist from LUCKYY 10P did not clearly indicate that it was from James\u2019s channel or that it contained the precise test information requested, particularly the CFM performance numbers of the two devices. I further attempted to scroll or locate the section with the relevant details using search techniques (Ctrl+F) on the provided content, but encountered either non-technical content or navigation issues.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\\\\\nI began by searching for \u201cJames\\\\\\\\\\\\'s channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d and related queries to identify content that might contain technical test data. The search results returned a YouTube playlist titled \u201cCHEATER BEATERS!\u201d from a channel called LUCKYY 10P and a video \\\"Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode\\\" from FilmRise Television. The latter appeared to be a reality TV episode concerning relationship issues and did not present technical CFM measurement details. Additionally, the playlist from LUCKYY 10P did not clearly indicate that it was from James\u2019s channel or that it contained the precise test information requested, particularly the CFM performance numbers of the two devices. I further attempted to scroll or locate the section with the relevant details using search techniques (Ctrl+F) on the provided content, but encountered either non-technical content or navigation issues. As a result, no clear evidence of specific CFM numbers (with the Cheater outperforming the Cheater Beater) was found.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\\\\\nGiven the ambiguity in sources \u2013 the search results did not return a verified video or document coming directly from a channel identified as \\\"James\u2019s channel\\\" that includes technical tests for these devices \u2013 it seems that the necessary details (the exact CFM values) might either be in a different resource or may require additional context or clarification regarding the exact source or link to refer to.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 're', 'sympy', 'io', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'itertools', 'queue', 'statistics', 'xml', 'random', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'PyPDF2', 'time', 'yahoo_finance', 'os', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'chess', 'pydub', 'PIL', 'scipy', 'datetime', 'requests', 'csv', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'numpy', 'torch']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nI began by searching for \u201cJames's channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d and related queries to identify content that might contain technical test data. The search results returned a YouTube playlist titled \u201cCHEATER BEATERS!\u201d from a channel called LUCKYY 10P and a video \"Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode\" from FilmRise Television. The latter appeared to be a reality TV episode concerning relationship issues and did not present technical CFM measurement details. Additionally, the playlist from LUCKYY 10P did not clearly indicate that it was from James\u2019s channel or that it contained the precise test information requested, particularly the CFM performance numbers of the two devices. I further attempted to scroll or locate the section with the relevant details using search techniques (Ctrl+F) on the provided content, but encountered either non-technical content or navigation issues. As a result, no clear evidence of specific CFM numbers (with the Cheater outperforming the Cheater Beater) was found.\n\n### 3.

Facts that we have learned:\\n\u2022 A search using keywords related to \u201cJames's channel Season 4,\u201d \u201cCheater,\u201d \u201cCheater Beater,\u201d and \u201cCFM\u201d returned a YouTube playlist titled \u201cCHEATER BEATERS!\u201d from LUCKYY 10P.\\n\u2022 Another search result found a video titled \u201cCheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode\u201d from FilmRise Television; however, this appears to be a reality TV episode about infidelity rather than a technical test involving CFM measurements.\\n\u2022 Attempts to navigate the YouTube playlist page using the page_down tool resulted in errors indicating that our scroll commands were not formatted correctly.\\n\u2022 There is no clear evidence yet from the available pages that the required detailed technical test with CFM numbers for the Cheater and Cheater Beater is directly available.\\n\\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\\n3.

Facts still to derive:\\n\u2022 The specific CFM number reported for the Cheater.\\n\u2022 The specific CFM number reported for the Cheater Beater.\\n\u2022 Verification that the Cheater\u2019s CFM is indeed higher than the Cheater Beater\u2019s CFM, as required by the task.\\n\u2022 Consolidation of these numbers into the final reporting format: \u201cCFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater.\u201d\\n\\nThis is our current state of knowledge and what remains to be confirmed.\\n```\"}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Calling tools:\\n[{\\'id\\': \\'call_gzE0MBAqgioAxMbEaAYwtgc8\\', \\'type\\': \\'function\\', \\'function\\': {\\'name\\': \\'final_answer\\', \\'arguments\\': {\\'answer\\': \\'### 1. Task outcome (short version):\\\\nI was unable to locate the specific Season 4 test details from James\u2019s channel that mention the CFM numbers for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater. \\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nI began by searching for \u201cJames\\\\\\'s channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d and related queries to identify content that might contain technical test data. The search results returned a YouTube playlist titled \u201cCHEATER BEATERS!\u201d from a channel called LUCKYY 10P and a video \"Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode\" from FilmRise Television. The latter appeared to be a reality TV episode concerning relationship issues and did not present technical CFM measurement details. Additionally, the playlist from LUCKYY 10P did not clearly indicate that it was from James\u2019s channel or that it contained the precise test information requested, particularly the CFM performance numbers of the two devices. I further attempted to scroll or locate the section with the relevant details using search techniques (Ctrl+F) on the provided content, but encountered either non-technical content or navigation issues. As a result, no clear evidence of specific CFM numbers (with the Cheater outperforming the Cheater Beater) was found.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nGiven the ambiguity in sources \u2013 the search results did not return a verified video or document coming directly from a channel identified as \"James\u2019s channel\" that includes technical tests for these devices \u2013 it seems that the necessary details (the exact CFM values) might either be in a different resource or may require additional context or clarification regarding the exact source or link to refer to. Please provide further clarification or a direct reference to the James\u2019s channel content containing these test details so I can assist further.\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",

Task outcome (short version):\\\\nI was unable to locate the specific Season 4 test details from James\u2019s channel that mention the CFM numbers for the Cheater and the Cheater Beater. \\\\n\\\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nI began by searching for \u201cJames\\\\\\'s channel season 4 Cheater Cheater Beater CFM test details\u201d and related queries to identify content that might contain technical test data. The search results returned a YouTube playlist titled \u201cCHEATER BEATERS!\u201d from a channel called LUCKYY 10P and a video \"Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 26 - Full Episode\" from FilmRise Television. The latter appeared to be a reality TV episode concerning relationship issues and did not present technical CFM measurement details. Additionally, the playlist from LUCKYY 10P did not clearly indicate that it was from James\u2019s channel or that it contained the precise test information requested, particularly the CFM performance numbers of the two devices. I further attempted to scroll or locate the section with the relevant details using search techniques (Ctrl+F) on the provided content, but encountered either non-technical content or navigation issues. As a result, no clear evidence of specific CFM numbers (with the Cheater outperforming the Cheater Beater) was found.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nGiven the ambiguity in sources \u2013 the search results did not return a verified video or document coming directly from a channel identified as \"James\u2019s channel\" that includes technical tests for these devices \u2013 it seems that the necessary details (the exact CFM values) might either be in a different resource or may require additional context or clarification regarding the exact source or link to refer to. Please provide further clarification or a direct reference to the James\u2019s channel content containing these test details so I can assist further.\\'}}}]'}]\n---\n</summary_of_work>",
