Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\", \"stream\": false, \"reset\": true, \"images\": null, \"additional_args\": null, \"max_steps\": null}",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}], \"stop_sequences\": [\"<end_code>\", \"Observation:\", \"Calling tools:\"], \"grammar\": null, \"tools_to_call_from\": null, \"kwargs\": {}}",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\nfrom_json does not correctly convert BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements\\n**Describe the bug**\\r\\nWhen a DICOM object contains large data elements in SQ elements and is converted to JSON, those elements are correctly turned into BulkDataURI's.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\nfrom_json does not correctly convert BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements\\n**Describe the bug**\\r\\nWhen a DICOM object contains large data elements in SQ elements and is converted to JSON, those elements are correctly turned into BulkDataURI's.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\nfrom_json does not correctly convert BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements\\n**Describe the bug**\\r\\nWhen a DICOM object contains large data elements in SQ elements and is converted to JSON, those elements are correctly turned into BulkDataURI's.

The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\nfrom_json does not correctly convert BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements\\n**Describe the bug**\\r\\nWhen a DICOM object contains large data elements in SQ elements and is converted to JSON, those elements are correctly turned into BulkDataURI's.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

However, when the JSON is converted back to DICOM using from_json, the BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements are not converted back and warnings are thrown.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements get converted back correctly.\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nTake the `waveform_ecg.dcm` in the test data, convert it to JSON, and then convert the JSON to DICOM\r\n\r\n**Your environment**\r\nmodule       | version\r\n------       | -------\r\nplatform     | macOS-10.15.7-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\nPython       | 3.8.2 (v3.8.2:7b3ab5921f, Feb 24 2020, 17:52:18)  [Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)]\r\npydicom      | 2.1.0\r\ngdcm         | _module not found_\r\njpeg_ls      | _module not found_\r\nnumpy        | _module not found_\r\nPIL          | _module not found_\r\n\r\nThe problem is in `jsonrep.py` at line 227.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

A single patch file can contain\nchanges to multiple files.\n<patch>\n--- a/file.py\n+++ b/file.py\n@@ -1,27 +1,35 @@\ndef euclidean(a, b):\n- while b:\n- a, b = b, a % b\n- return a\n+ if b == 0:\n+ return a\n+ return euclidean(b, a % b)\n\ndef bresenham(x0, y0, x1, y1):\npoints = []\ndx = abs(x1 - x0)\ndy = abs(y1 - y0)\n- sx = 1 if x0 < x1 else -1\n- sy = 1 if y0 < y1 else -1\n- err = dx - dy\n+ x, y = x0, y0\n+ sx = -1 if x0 > x1 else 1\n+ sy = -1 if y0 > y1 else 1\n- while True:\n- points.append((x0, y0))\n- if x0 == x1 and y0 == y1:\n- break\n- e2 = 2 * err\n- if e2 > -dy:\n+ if dx > dy:\n+ err = dx / 2.0\n+ while x != x1:\n+ points.append((x, y))\nerr -= dy\n- x0 += sx\n- if e2 < dx:\n- err += dx\n- y0 += sy\n+ if err < 0:\n+ y += sy\n+ err += dx\n+ x += sx\n+ else:\n+ err = dy / 2.0\n+ while y != y1:\n+ points.append((x, y))\n+ err -= dx\n+ if err < 0:\n+ x += sx\n+ err += dy\n+ y += sy\n+ points.append((x, y))\nreturn points\n\n</patch>\n\nI need you to solve the provided issue by generating a single patch file that I can apply directly to this repository using git apply. Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\nfrom_json does not correctly convert BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements\\n**Describe the bug**\\r\\nWhen a DICOM object contains large data elements in SQ elements and is converted to JSON, those elements are correctly turned into BulkDataURI's.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \\\"pythonic\\\" way.\\n\\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\\n\\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\\n```\\npip install pydicom\\n```\\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\\n```\\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\\n\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\\n\\n## *Pixel Data*\\n\\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\\n```python\\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\\n<class 'bytes'>\\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\\n32768\\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\\nb'\\\\xaf\\\\x00'\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\\n>>> arr.shape\\n(128, 128)\\n>>> arr\\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\\n       ...,\\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\\n```\\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\\n\\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\\n\\n#### RLE\\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\\n\\n## Examples\\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\\n\\n**Change a patient's ID**\\n```python\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\n\\nds = dcmread(\\\"/path/to/file.dcm\\\")\\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\\nds.PatientID = \\\"12345678\\\"\\nds.save_as(\\\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\\\")\\n```\\n\\n**Display the Pixel Data**\\n\\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n\\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\\npath = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\nds = dcmread(path)\\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\\narr = ds.pixel_array\\n\\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\\\"gray\\\")\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\\n================================================\\n\\nContributing to pydicom\\n=======================\\n\\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\\ncontribution being merged.\\n\\n_Note:_  \\nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \\nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \\ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\\n\\n\\nHow to contribute\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\\n\\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\\n\\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\\n   $ cd pydicom\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\\n\\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git add modified_files\\n   $ git commit\\n   ```\\n\\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \\\"squash-merged\\\", e.g.\\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \\n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\\n   \\n   ```\\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\\n   \\n   -  closes #1016\\n   ```\\n   ```\\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \\n   ``` \\n   ```\\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\\n   \\n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\\n   - see #537\\n   ```\\n   \\n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\\n   account with:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\\n\\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\\n\\nPull Request Checklist\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\\nsubmit a pull request:\\n\\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\\n   for documentation.\\n   \\n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\\n   created. Use \\\"closes #issue-number\\\" or \\\"fixes #issue-number\\\" to let GitHub \\n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \\n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\\n\\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\\n\\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \\n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\\n   inclusion of a\\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\\n   in the PR description.\\n\\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\\n\\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \\n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \\n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\\n\\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\\nfollowing tools:\\n\\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\\n with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pyflakes\\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \\n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install autopep8\\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\\n  ```\\n\\nFiling bugs\\n-----------\\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\\n\\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\\nfollowing rules before submitting:\\n\\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\\n\\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\\n   appropriate code blocks.\\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\\n\\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\\n\\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\\n   module to gather this information :\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\\n   ```\\n\\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\\n   print(platform.platform(),\\n         \\\"\\\\nPython\\\", sys.version,\\n         \\\"\\\\npydicom\\\", pydicom.__version__)\\n   ```\\n\\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\\n``doc/`` directory.\\n\\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\\n\\nFor building the documentation, you will need\\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\\n\\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: LICENSE\\n================================================\\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\\n\\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\nfrom_json does not correctly convert BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements\\n**Describe the bug**\\r\\nWhen a DICOM object contains large data elements in SQ elements and is converted to JSON, those elements are correctly turned into BulkDataURI's.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \\\"pythonic\\\" way.\\n\\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\\n\\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\\n```\\npip install pydicom\\n```\\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\\n```\\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\\n\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\\n\\n## *Pixel Data*\\n\\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\\n```python\\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\\n<class 'bytes'>\\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\\n32768\\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\\nb'\\\\xaf\\\\x00'\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\\n>>> arr.shape\\n(128, 128)\\n>>> arr\\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\\n       ...,\\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\\n```\\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\\n\\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\\n\\n#### RLE\\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\\n\\n## Examples\\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\\n\\n**Change a patient's ID**\\n```python\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\n\\nds = dcmread(\\\"/path/to/file.dcm\\\")\\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\\nds.PatientID = \\\"12345678\\\"\\nds.save_as(\\\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\\\")\\n```\\n\\n**Display the Pixel Data**\\n\\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n\\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\\npath = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\nds = dcmread(path)\\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\\narr = ds.pixel_array\\n\\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\\\"gray\\\")\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\\n================================================\\n\\nContributing to pydicom\\n=======================\\n\\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\\ncontribution being merged.\\n\\n_Note:_  \\nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \\nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \\ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\\n\\n\\nHow to contribute\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\\n\\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\\n\\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\\n   $ cd pydicom\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\\n\\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git add modified_files\\n   $ git commit\\n   ```\\n\\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \\\"squash-merged\\\", e.g.\\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \\n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\\n   \\n   ```\\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\\n   \\n   -  closes #1016\\n   ```\\n   ```\\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \\n   ``` \\n   ```\\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\\n   \\n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\\n   - see #537\\n   ```\\n   \\n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\\n   account with:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\\n\\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\\n\\nPull Request Checklist\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\\nsubmit a pull request:\\n\\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\\n   for documentation.\\n   \\n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\\n   created. Use \\\"closes #issue-number\\\" or \\\"fixes #issue-number\\\" to let GitHub \\n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \\n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\\n\\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\\n\\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \\n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\\n   inclusion of a\\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\\n   in the PR description.\\n\\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\\n\\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \\n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \\n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\\n\\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\\nfollowing tools:\\n\\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\\n with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pyflakes\\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \\n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install autopep8\\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\\n  ```\\n\\nFiling bugs\\n-----------\\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\\n\\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\\nfollowing rules before submitting:\\n\\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\\n\\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\\n   appropriate code blocks.\\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\\n\\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\\n\\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\\n   module to gather this information :\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\\n   ```\\n\\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\\n   print(platform.platform(),\\n         \\\"\\\\nPython\\\", sys.version,\\n         \\\"\\\\npydicom\\\", pydicom.__version__)\\n   ```\\n\\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\\n   raised, please provide the traceback.

The resulting HTML files will\\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\\n\\nFor building the documentation, you will need\\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\\n\\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: LICENSE\\n================================================\\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\\n\\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``. The\n    actual preamble written depends on `write_like_original` and\n    ``dataset.preamble`` (see the table below).\n\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n    |                  | write_like_original          |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | dataset.preamble | True        | False          |\n    +==================+=============+================+\n    | None             | no preamble | 128 0x00 bytes |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | 128 bytes        | dataset.preamble             |\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n\n    The prefix shall be the bytestring ``b'DICM'`` and will be written if and\n    only if the preamble is present.\n\n    **File Meta Information Group Elements**\n\n    The preamble and prefix are followed by a set of DICOM elements from the\n    (0002,eeee) group. Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent. The File Meta elements\n    are encoded as *Explicit VR Little Endian* as required by the DICOM\n    Standard.\n\n    **Dataset**\n\n    A DICOM Dataset representing a SOP Instance related to a DICOM Information\n    Object Definition. It is up to the user to ensure the `dataset` conforms\n    to the DICOM Standard.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The `dataset` is encoded as specified by the ``dataset.is_little_endian``\n    and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes. It's up to the user to ensure\n    these attributes are set correctly (as well as setting an appropriate\n    value for ``dataset.file_meta.TransferSyntaxUID`` if present).\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    filename : str or PathLike or file-like\n        Name of file or the file-like to write the new DICOM file to.\n    dataset : pydicom.dataset.FileDataset\n        Dataset holding the DICOM information;

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \\\"pythonic\\\" way.\\n\\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\\n\\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\\n```\\npip install pydicom\\n```\\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\\n```\\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\\n\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\\n\\n## *Pixel Data*\\n\\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\\n```python\\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\\n<class 'bytes'>\\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\\n32768\\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\\nb'\\\\xaf\\\\x00'\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\\n>>> arr.shape\\n(128, 128)\\n>>> arr\\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\\n       ...,\\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\\n```\\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\\n\\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\\n\\n#### RLE\\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\\n\\n## Examples\\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\\n\\n**Change a patient's ID**\\n```python\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\n\\nds = dcmread(\\\"/path/to/file.dcm\\\")\\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\\nds.PatientID = \\\"12345678\\\"\\nds.save_as(\\\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\\\")\\n```\\n\\n**Display the Pixel Data**\\n\\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n\\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\\npath = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\nds = dcmread(path)\\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\\narr = ds.pixel_array\\n\\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\\\"gray\\\")\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\\n================================================\\n\\nContributing to pydicom\\n=======================\\n\\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\\ncontribution being merged.\\n\\n_Note:_  \\nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \\nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \\ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\\n\\n\\nHow to contribute\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\\n\\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\\n\\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\\n   $ cd pydicom\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\\n\\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git add modified_files\\n   $ git commit\\n   ```\\n\\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \\\"squash-merged\\\", e.g.\\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \\n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\\n   \\n   ```\\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\\n   \\n   -  closes #1016\\n   ```\\n   ```\\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \\n   ``` \\n   ```\\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\\n   \\n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\\n   - see #537\\n   ```\\n   \\n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\\n   account with:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\\n\\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\\n\\nPull Request Checklist\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\\nsubmit a pull request:\\n\\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\\n   for documentation.\\n   \\n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\\n   created. Use \\\"closes #issue-number\\\" or \\\"fixes #issue-number\\\" to let GitHub \\n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \\n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\\n\\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\\n\\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \\n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\\n   inclusion of a\\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\\n   in the PR description.\\n\\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\\n\\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \\n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \\n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\\n\\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\\nfollowing tools:\\n\\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\\n with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pyflakes\\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \\n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install autopep8\\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\\n  ```\\n\\nFiling bugs\\n-----------\\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\\n\\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\\nfollowing rules before submitting:\\n\\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\\n\\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\\n   appropriate code blocks.\\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\\n\\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\\n\\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\\n   module to gather this information :\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\\n   ```\\n\\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\\n   print(platform.platform(),\\n         \\\"\\\\nPython\\\", sys.version,\\n         \\\"\\\\npydicom\\\", pydicom.__version__)\\n   ```\\n\\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\\n``doc/`` directory.\\n\\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\\n\\nFor building the documentation, you will need\\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\\n\\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: LICENSE\\n================================================\\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\\n\\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``. The\n    actual preamble written depends on `write_like_original` and\n    ``dataset.preamble`` (see the table below).\n\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n    |                  | write_like_original          |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | dataset.preamble | True        | False          |\n    +==================+=============+================+\n    | None             | no preamble | 128 0x00 bytes |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | 128 bytes        | dataset.preamble             |\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n\n    The prefix shall be the bytestring ``b'DICM'`` and will be written if and\n    only if the preamble is present.\n\n    **File Meta Information Group Elements**\n\n    The preamble and prefix are followed by a set of DICOM elements from the\n    (0002,eeee) group. Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent. The File Meta elements\n    are encoded as *Explicit VR Little Endian* as required by the DICOM\n    Standard.\n\n    **Dataset**\n\n    A DICOM Dataset representing a SOP Instance related to a DICOM Information\n    Object Definition. It is up to the user to ensure the `dataset` conforms\n    to the DICOM Standard.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The `dataset` is encoded as specified by the ``dataset.is_little_endian``\n    and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes. It's up to the user to ensure\n    these attributes are set correctly (as well as setting an appropriate\n    value for ``dataset.file_meta.TransferSyntaxUID`` if present).\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    filename : str or PathLike or file-like\n        Name of file or the file-like to write the new DICOM file to.\n    dataset : pydicom.dataset.FileDataset\n        Dataset holding the DICOM information;

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\nfrom_json does not correctly convert BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements\\n**Describe the bug**\\r\\nWhen a DICOM object contains large data elements in SQ elements and is converted to JSON, those elements are correctly turned into BulkDataURI's.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \\\"pythonic\\\" way.\\n\\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\\n\\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\\n```\\npip install pydicom\\n```\\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\\n```\\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\\n\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\\n\\n## *Pixel Data*\\n\\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\\n```python\\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\\n<class 'bytes'>\\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\\n32768\\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\\nb'\\\\xaf\\\\x00'\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\\n>>> arr.shape\\n(128, 128)\\n>>> arr\\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\\n       ...,\\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\\n```\\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\\n\\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\\n\\n#### RLE\\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\\n\\n## Examples\\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\\n\\n**Change a patient's ID**\\n```python\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\n\\nds = dcmread(\\\"/path/to/file.dcm\\\")\\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\\nds.PatientID = \\\"12345678\\\"\\nds.save_as(\\\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\\\")\\n```\\n\\n**Display the Pixel Data**\\n\\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n\\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\\npath = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\nds = dcmread(path)\\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\\narr = ds.pixel_array\\n\\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\\\"gray\\\")\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\\n================================================\\n\\nContributing to pydicom\\n=======================\\n\\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\\ncontribution being merged.\\n\\n_Note:_  \\nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \\nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \\ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\\n\\n\\nHow to contribute\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\\n\\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\\n\\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\\n   $ cd pydicom\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\\n\\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git add modified_files\\n   $ git commit\\n   ```\\n\\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \\\"squash-merged\\\", e.g.\\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \\n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\\n   \\n   ```\\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\\n   \\n   -  closes #1016\\n   ```\\n   ```\\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \\n   ``` \\n   ```\\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\\n   \\n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\\n   - see #537\\n   ```\\n   \\n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\\n   account with:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\\n\\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\\n\\nPull Request Checklist\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\\nsubmit a pull request:\\n\\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\\n   for documentation.\\n   \\n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\\n   created. Use \\\"closes #issue-number\\\" or \\\"fixes #issue-number\\\" to let GitHub \\n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \\n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\\n\\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\\n\\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \\n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\\n   inclusion of a\\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\\n   in the PR description.\\n\\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\\n\\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \\n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \\n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\\n\\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\\nfollowing tools:\\n\\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\\n with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pyflakes\\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \\n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install autopep8\\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\\n  ```\\n\\nFiling bugs\\n-----------\\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\\n\\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\\nfollowing rules before submitting:\\n\\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\\n\\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\\n   appropriate code blocks.\\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\\n\\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\\n\\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\\n   module to gather this information :\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\\n   ```\\n\\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\\n   print(platform.platform(),\\n         \\\"\\\\nPython\\\", sys.version,\\n         \\\"\\\\npydicom\\\", pydicom.__version__)\\n   ```\\n\\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\\n``doc/`` directory.\\n\\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\\n\\nFor building the documentation, you will need\\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\\n\\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: LICENSE\\n================================================\\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\\n\\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``. The\n    actual preamble written depends on `write_like_original` and\n    ``dataset.preamble`` (see the table below).\n\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n    |                  | write_like_original          |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | dataset.preamble | True        | False          |\n    +==================+=============+================+\n    | None             | no preamble | 128 0x00 bytes |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | 128 bytes        | dataset.preamble             |\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n\n    The prefix shall be the bytestring ``b'DICM'`` and will be written if and\n    only if the preamble is present.\n\n    **File Meta Information Group Elements**\n\n    The preamble and prefix are followed by a set of DICOM elements from the\n    (0002,eeee) group. Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent. The File Meta elements\n    are encoded as *Explicit VR Little Endian* as required by the DICOM\n    Standard.\n\n    **Dataset**\n\n    A DICOM Dataset representing a SOP Instance related to a DICOM Information\n    Object Definition. It is up to the user to ensure the `dataset` conforms\n    to the DICOM Standard.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The `dataset` is encoded as specified by the ``dataset.is_little_endian``\n    and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes. It's up to the user to ensure\n    these attributes are set correctly (as well as setting an appropriate\n    value for ``dataset.file_meta.TransferSyntaxUID`` if present).\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    filename : str or PathLike or file-like\n        Name of file or the file-like to write the new DICOM file to.\n    dataset : pydicom.dataset.FileDataset\n        Dataset holding the DICOM information;

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\nfrom_json does not correctly convert BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements\\n**Describe the bug**\\r\\nWhen a DICOM object contains large data elements in SQ elements and is converted to JSON, those elements are correctly turned into BulkDataURI's.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \\\"pythonic\\\" way.\\n\\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\\n\\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\\n```\\npip install pydicom\\n```\\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\\n```\\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\\n\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\\n\\n## *Pixel Data*\\n\\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\\n```python\\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\\n<class 'bytes'>\\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\\n32768\\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\\nb'\\\\xaf\\\\x00'\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\\n>>> arr.shape\\n(128, 128)\\n>>> arr\\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\\n       ...,\\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\\n```\\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\\n\\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\\n\\n#### RLE\\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\\n\\n## Examples\\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\\n\\n**Change a patient's ID**\\n```python\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\n\\nds = dcmread(\\\"/path/to/file.dcm\\\")\\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\\nds.PatientID = \\\"12345678\\\"\\nds.save_as(\\\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\\\")\\n```\\n\\n**Display the Pixel Data**\\n\\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n\\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\\npath = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\nds = dcmread(path)\\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\\narr = ds.pixel_array\\n\\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\\\"gray\\\")\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\\n================================================\\n\\nContributing to pydicom\\n=======================\\n\\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\\ncontribution being merged.\\n\\n_Note:_  \\nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \\nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \\ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\\n\\n\\nHow to contribute\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\\n\\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\\n\\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\\n   $ cd pydicom\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\\n\\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git add modified_files\\n   $ git commit\\n   ```\\n\\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \\\"squash-merged\\\", e.g.\\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \\n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\\n   \\n   ```\\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\\n   \\n   -  closes #1016\\n   ```\\n   ```\\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \\n   ``` \\n   ```\\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\\n   \\n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\\n   - see #537\\n   ```\\n   \\n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\\n   account with:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\\n\\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\\n\\nPull Request Checklist\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\\nsubmit a pull request:\\n\\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\\n   for documentation.\\n   \\n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\\n   created. Use \\\"closes #issue-number\\\" or \\\"fixes #issue-number\\\" to let GitHub \\n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \\n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\\n\\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\\n\\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \\n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\\n   inclusion of a\\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\\n   in the PR description.\\n\\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\\n\\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \\n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \\n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\\n\\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\\nfollowing tools:\\n\\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\\n with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pyflakes\\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \\n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install autopep8\\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\\n  ```\\n\\nFiling bugs\\n-----------\\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\\n\\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\\nfollowing rules before submitting:\\n\\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\\n\\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\\n   appropriate code blocks.\\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\\n\\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\\n\\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\\n   module to gather this information :\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\\n   ```\\n\\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\\n   print(platform.platform(),\\n         \\\"\\\\nPython\\\", sys.version,\\n         \\\"\\\\npydicom\\\", pydicom.__version__)\\n   ```\\n\\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\\n``doc/`` directory.\\n\\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\\n\\nFor building the documentation, you will need\\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\\n\\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: LICENSE\\n================================================\\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\\n\\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

To do\n    so requires that the ``Dataset.file_meta`` attribute\n    exists and contains a :class:`Dataset` with the required (Type 1) *File\n    Meta Information Group* elements. The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``. The\n    actual preamble written depends on `write_like_original` and\n    ``dataset.preamble`` (see the table below).\n\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n    |                  | write_like_original          |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | dataset.preamble | True        | False          |\n    +==================+=============+================+\n    | None             | no preamble | 128 0x00 bytes |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | 128 bytes        | dataset.preamble             |\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n\n    The prefix shall be the bytestring ``b'DICM'`` and will be written if and\n    only if the preamble is present.\n\n    **File Meta Information Group Elements**\n\n    The preamble and prefix are followed by a set of DICOM elements from the\n    (0002,eeee) group. Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\nfrom_json does not correctly convert BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements\\n**Describe the bug**\\r\\nWhen a DICOM object contains large data elements in SQ elements and is converted to JSON, those elements are correctly turned into BulkDataURI's.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \\\"pythonic\\\" way.\\n\\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\\n\\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\\n```\\npip install pydicom\\n```\\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\\n```\\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\\n\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\\n\\n## *Pixel Data*\\n\\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\\n```python\\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\\n<class 'bytes'>\\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\\n32768\\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\\nb'\\\\xaf\\\\x00'\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\\n>>> arr.shape\\n(128, 128)\\n>>> arr\\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\\n       ...,\\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\\n```\\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\\n\\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\\n\\n#### RLE\\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\\n\\n## Examples\\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\\n\\n**Change a patient's ID**\\n```python\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\n\\nds = dcmread(\\\"/path/to/file.dcm\\\")\\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\\nds.PatientID = \\\"12345678\\\"\\nds.save_as(\\\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\\\")\\n```\\n\\n**Display the Pixel Data**\\n\\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n\\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\\npath = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\nds = dcmread(path)\\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\\narr = ds.pixel_array\\n\\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\\\"gray\\\")\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\\n================================================\\n\\nContributing to pydicom\\n=======================\\n\\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\\ncontribution being merged.\\n\\n_Note:_  \\nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \\nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \\ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\\n\\n\\nHow to contribute\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\\n\\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\\n\\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\\n   $ cd pydicom\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\\n\\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git add modified_files\\n   $ git commit\\n   ```\\n\\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \\\"squash-merged\\\", e.g.\\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \\n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\\n   \\n   ```\\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\\n   \\n   -  closes #1016\\n   ```\\n   ```\\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \\n   ``` \\n   ```\\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\\n   \\n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\\n   - see #537\\n   ```\\n   \\n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\\n   account with:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\\n\\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\\n\\nPull Request Checklist\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\\nsubmit a pull request:\\n\\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\\n   for documentation.\\n   \\n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\\n   created. Use \\\"closes #issue-number\\\" or \\\"fixes #issue-number\\\" to let GitHub \\n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \\n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\\n\\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\\n\\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \\n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\\n   inclusion of a\\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\\n   in the PR description.\\n\\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\\n\\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \\n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \\n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\\n\\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\\nfollowing tools:\\n\\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\\n with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pyflakes\\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \\n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install autopep8\\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\\n  ```\\n\\nFiling bugs\\n-----------\\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\\n\\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\\nfollowing rules before submitting:\\n\\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\\n\\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\\n   appropriate code blocks.\\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\\n\\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\\n\\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\\n   module to gather this information :\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\\n   ```\\n\\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\\n   print(platform.platform(),\\n         \\\"\\\\nPython\\\", sys.version,\\n         \\\"\\\\npydicom\\\", pydicom.__version__)\\n   ```\\n\\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\\n``doc/`` directory.\\n\\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\\n\\nFor building the documentation, you will need\\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\\n\\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: LICENSE\\n================================================\\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\\n\\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``.

Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \\\"pythonic\\\" way.\\n\\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\\n\\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\\n```\\npip install pydicom\\n```\\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\\n```\\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\\n\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\\n\\n## *Pixel Data*\\n\\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\\n```python\\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\\n<class 'bytes'>\\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\\n32768\\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\\nb'\\\\xaf\\\\x00'\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\\n>>> arr.shape\\n(128, 128)\\n>>> arr\\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\\n       ...,\\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\\n```\\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\\n\\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\\n\\n#### RLE\\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\\n\\n## Examples\\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\\n\\n**Change a patient's ID**\\n```python\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\n\\nds = dcmread(\\\"/path/to/file.dcm\\\")\\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\\nds.PatientID = \\\"12345678\\\"\\nds.save_as(\\\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\\\")\\n```\\n\\n**Display the Pixel Data**\\n\\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n\\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\\npath = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\nds = dcmread(path)\\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\\narr = ds.pixel_array\\n\\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\\\"gray\\\")\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\\n================================================\\n\\nContributing to pydicom\\n=======================\\n\\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\\ncontribution being merged.\\n\\n_Note:_  \\nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \\nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \\ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\\n\\n\\nHow to contribute\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\\n\\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\\n\\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\\n   $ cd pydicom\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\\n\\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git add modified_files\\n   $ git commit\\n   ```\\n\\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \\\"squash-merged\\\", e.g.\\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \\n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\\n   \\n   ```\\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\\n   \\n   -  closes #1016\\n   ```\\n   ```\\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \\n   ``` \\n   ```\\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\\n   \\n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\\n   - see #537\\n   ```\\n   \\n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\\n   account with:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\\n\\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\\n\\nPull Request Checklist\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\\nsubmit a pull request:\\n\\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\\n   for documentation.\\n   \\n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\\n   created. Use \\\"closes #issue-number\\\" or \\\"fixes #issue-number\\\" to let GitHub \\n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \\n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\\n\\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\\n\\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \\n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\\n   inclusion of a\\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\\n   in the PR description.\\n\\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\\n\\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \\n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \\n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\\n\\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\\nfollowing tools:\\n\\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\\n with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pyflakes\\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \\n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install autopep8\\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\\n  ```\\n\\nFiling bugs\\n-----------\\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\\n\\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\\nfollowing rules before submitting:\\n\\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\\n\\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\\n   appropriate code blocks.\\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\\n\\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\\n\\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\\n   module to gather this information :\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\\n   ```\\n\\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\\n   print(platform.platform(),\\n         \\\"\\\\nPython\\\", sys.version,\\n         \\\"\\\\npydicom\\\", pydicom.__version__)\\n   ```\\n\\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\\n``doc/`` directory.\\n\\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\\n\\nFor building the documentation, you will need\\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\\n\\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: LICENSE\\n================================================\\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\\n\\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``.

Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \\\"pythonic\\\" way.\\n\\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\\n\\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\\n```\\npip install pydicom\\n```\\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\\n```\\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\\n\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\\n\\n## *Pixel Data*\\n\\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\\n```python\\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\\n<class 'bytes'>\\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\\n32768\\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\\nb'\\\\xaf\\\\x00'\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\\n>>> arr.shape\\n(128, 128)\\n>>> arr\\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\\n       ...,\\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\\n```\\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\\n\\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\\n\\n#### RLE\\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\\n\\n## Examples\\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\\n\\n**Change a patient's ID**\\n```python\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\n\\nds = dcmread(\\\"/path/to/file.dcm\\\")\\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\\nds.PatientID = \\\"12345678\\\"\\nds.save_as(\\\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\\\")\\n```\\n\\n**Display the Pixel Data**\\n\\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n\\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\\npath = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\nds = dcmread(path)\\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\\narr = ds.pixel_array\\n\\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\\\"gray\\\")\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\\n================================================\\n\\nContributing to pydicom\\n=======================\\n\\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\\ncontribution being merged.\\n\\n_Note:_  \\nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \\nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \\ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\\n\\n\\nHow to contribute\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\\n\\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\\n\\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\\n   $ cd pydicom\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\\n\\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git add modified_files\\n   $ git commit\\n   ```\\n\\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \\\"squash-merged\\\", e.g.\\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \\n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\\n   \\n   ```\\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\\n   \\n   -  closes #1016\\n   ```\\n   ```\\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \\n   ``` \\n   ```\\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\\n   \\n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\\n   - see #537\\n   ```\\n   \\n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\\n   account with:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\\n\\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\\n\\nPull Request Checklist\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\\nsubmit a pull request:\\n\\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\\n   for documentation.\\n   \\n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\\n   created. Use \\\"closes #issue-number\\\" or \\\"fixes #issue-number\\\" to let GitHub \\n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \\n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\\n\\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\\n\\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \\n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\\n   inclusion of a\\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\\n   in the PR description.\\n\\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\\n\\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \\n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \\n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\\n\\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\\nfollowing tools:\\n\\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\\n with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pyflakes\\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \\n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install autopep8\\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\\n  ```\\n\\nFiling bugs\\n-----------\\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\\n\\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\\nfollowing rules before submitting:\\n\\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\\n\\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\\n   appropriate code blocks.\\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\\n\\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\\n\\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\\n   module to gather this information :\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\\n   ```\\n\\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\\n   print(platform.platform(),\\n         \\\"\\\\nPython\\\", sys.version,\\n         \\\"\\\\npydicom\\\", pydicom.__version__)\\n   ```\\n\\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\\n``doc/`` directory.\\n\\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\\n\\nFor building the documentation, you will need\\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\\n\\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: LICENSE\\n================================================\\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\\n\\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``.

Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\nfrom_json does not correctly convert BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements\\n**Describe the bug**\\r\\nWhen a DICOM object contains large data elements in SQ elements and is converted to JSON, those elements are correctly turned into BulkDataURI's.

Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by building a patch file to fix the problem with `from_json` not correctly converting BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements.

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \\\"pythonic\\\" way.\\n\\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\\n\\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\\n```\\npip install pydicom\\n```\\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\\n```\\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\\n```\\n\\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\\n\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\\n\\n## *Pixel Data*\\n\\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\\n```python\\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\\n<class 'bytes'>\\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\\n32768\\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\\nb'\\\\xaf\\\\x00'\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\\n>>> arr.shape\\n(128, 128)\\n>>> arr\\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\\n       ...,\\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\\n```\\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\\n\\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\\n\\n#### RLE\\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\\n\\n## Examples\\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\\n\\n**Change a patient's ID**\\n```python\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\n\\nds = dcmread(\\\"/path/to/file.dcm\\\")\\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\\nds.PatientID = \\\"12345678\\\"\\nds.save_as(\\\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\\\")\\n```\\n\\n**Display the Pixel Data**\\n\\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\\n```python\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\\n\\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\\npath = get_testdata_file(\\\"CT_small.dcm\\\")\\nds = dcmread(path)\\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\\narr = ds.pixel_array\\n\\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\\\"gray\\\")\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\\n================================================\\n\\nContributing to pydicom\\n=======================\\n\\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\\ncontribution being merged.\\n\\n_Note:_  \\nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \\nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \\ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\\n\\n\\nHow to contribute\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\\n\\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\\n\\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\\n   $ cd pydicom\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\\n\\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git add modified_files\\n   $ git commit\\n   ```\\n\\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \\\"squash-merged\\\", e.g.\\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \\n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\\n   \\n   ```\\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\\n   \\n   -  closes #1016\\n   ```\\n   ```\\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \\n   ``` \\n   ```\\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\\n   \\n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\\n   - see #537\\n   ```\\n   \\n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\\n   account with:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\\n   ```\\n\\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\\n\\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\\n\\nPull Request Checklist\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\\nsubmit a pull request:\\n\\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\\n   for documentation.\\n   \\n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\\n   created. Use \\\"closes #issue-number\\\" or \\\"fixes #issue-number\\\" to let GitHub \\n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \\n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\\n\\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\\n\\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \\n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\\n   inclusion of a\\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\\n   in the PR description.\\n\\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\\n\\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \\n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \\n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\\n\\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\\nfollowing tools:\\n\\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\\n with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pyflakes\\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \\n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\\n  ```\\n\\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ pip install autopep8\\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\\n  ```\\n\\nFiling bugs\\n-----------\\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\\n\\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\\nfollowing rules before submitting:\\n\\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\\n\\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\\n   appropriate code blocks.\\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\\n\\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\\n\\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\\n   module to gather this information :\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\\n   ```\\n\\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\\n   print(platform.platform(),\\n         \\\"\\\\nPython\\\", sys.version,\\n         \\\"\\\\npydicom\\\", pydicom.__version__)\\n   ```\\n\\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\\n``doc/`` directory.\\n\\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\\n\\nFor building the documentation, you will need\\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\\n\\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\\n\\n\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: LICENSE\\n================================================\\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\\n\\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\\"Software\\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

To do\n    so requires that the ``Dataset.file_meta`` attribute\n    exists and contains a :class:`Dataset` with the required (Type 1) *File\n    Meta Information Group* elements. The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``. The\n    actual preamble written depends on `write_like_original` and\n    ``dataset.preamble`` (see the table below).\n\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n    |                  | write_like_original          |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | dataset.preamble | True        | False          |\n    +==================+=============+================+\n    | None             | no preamble | 128 0x00 bytes |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | 128 bytes        | dataset.preamble             |\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n\n    The prefix shall be the bytestring ``b'DICM'`` and will be written if and\n    only if the preamble is present.\n\n    **File Meta Information Group Elements**\n\n    The preamble and prefix are followed by a set of DICOM elements from the\n    (0002,eeee) group. Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/49a3da4a3d9c24d7e8427a25048a1c7d5c4f7724\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``. The\n    actual preamble written depends on `write_like_original` and\n    ``dataset.preamble`` (see the table below).\n\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n    |                  | write_like_original          |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | dataset.preamble | True        | False          |\n    +==================+=============+================+\n    | None             | no preamble | 128 0x00 bytes |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | 128 bytes        | dataset.preamble             |\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n\n    The prefix shall be the bytestring ``b'DICM'`` and will be written if and\n    only if the preamble is present.\n\n    **File Meta Information Group Elements**\n\n    The preamble and prefix are followed by a set of DICOM elements from the\n    (0002,eeee) group. Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent. The File Meta elements\n    are encoded as *Explicit VR Little Endian* as required by the DICOM\n    Standard.\n\n    **Dataset**\n\n    A DICOM Dataset representing a SOP Instance related to a DICOM Information\n    Object Definition. It is up to the user to ensure the `dataset` conforms\n    to the DICOM Standard.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The `dataset` is encoded as specified by the ``dataset.is_little_endian``\n    and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes. It's up to the user to ensure\n    these attributes are set correctly (as well as setting an appropriate\n    value for ``dataset.file_meta.TransferSyntaxUID`` if present).\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    filename : str or PathLike or file-like\n        Name of file or the file-like to write the new DICOM file to.\n    dataset : pydicom.dataset.FileDataset\n        Dataset holding the DICOM information;

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

To do\n    so requires that the ``Dataset.file_meta`` attribute\n    exists and contains a :class:`Dataset` with the required (Type 1) *File\n    Meta Information Group* elements. The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``. The\n    actual preamble written depends on `write_like_original` and\n    ``dataset.preamble`` (see the table below).\n\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n    |                  | write_like_original          |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | dataset.preamble | True        | False          |\n    +==================+=============+================+\n    | None             | no preamble | 128 0x00 bytes |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | 128 bytes        | dataset.preamble             |\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n\n    The prefix shall be the bytestring ``b'DICM'`` and will be written if and\n    only if the preamble is present.\n\n    **File Meta Information Group Elements**\n\n    The preamble and prefix are followed by a set of DICOM elements from the\n    (0002,eeee) group. Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent.

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/).

The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``.

Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent.

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/). Try to make the\nexplanations intuitive and understandable also for users not fluent in DICOM.\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: LICENSE\n================================================\nLicense file for pydicom, a pure-python DICOM library\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2020 Darcy Mason and pydicom contributors\n\nExcept for portions outlined below, pydicom is released under an MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``. The\n    actual preamble written depends on `write_like_original` and\n    ``dataset.preamble`` (see the table below).\n\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n    |                  | write_like_original          |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | dataset.preamble | True        | False          |\n    +==================+=============+================+\n    | None             | no preamble | 128 0x00 bytes |\n    +------------------+-------------+----------------+\n    | 128 bytes        | dataset.preamble             |\n    +------------------+------------------------------+\n\n    The prefix shall be the bytestring ``b'DICM'`` and will be written if and\n    only if the preamble is present.\n\n    **File Meta Information Group Elements**\n\n    The preamble and prefix are followed by a set of DICOM elements from the\n    (0002,eeee) group. Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent. The File Meta elements\n    are encoded as *Explicit VR Little Endian* as required by the DICOM\n    Standard.\n\n    **Dataset**\n\n    A DICOM Dataset representing a SOP Instance related to a DICOM Information\n    Object Definition. It is up to the user to ensure the `dataset` conforms\n    to the DICOM Standard.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The `dataset` is encoded as specified by the ``dataset.is_little_endian``\n    and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes. It's up to the user to ensure\n    these attributes are set correctly (as well as setting an appropriate\n    value for ``dataset.file_meta.TransferSyntaxUID`` if present).\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    filename : str or PathLike or file-like\n        Name of file or the file-like to write the new DICOM file to.\n    dataset : pydicom.dataset.FileDataset\n        Dataset holding the DICOM information;

In the `get_sequence_item` method of `JsonDataElementConverter`, when handling a sequence (SQ) element, it calls `DataElement.from_json` to create dataset items. However, it doesn't pass the `bulk_data_uri_handler` to these recursive calls, which is why BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements aren't being handled correctly.\n\nLet me create a patch to fix this issue by modifying the `get_sequence_item` method to pass the `bulk_data_uri_handler` to the recursive call.\n\nCode:\n```py\n# Create the patch\npatch = \"\"\"--- a/pydicom/jsonrep.py\n+++ b/pydicom/jsonrep.py\n@@ -227,7 +227,8 @@ class JsonDataElementConverter:\n                     value_key = unique_value_keys[0]\n                     elem = DataElement.from_json(\n                         self.dataset_class, key, vr,\n-                        val[value_key], value_key\n+                        val[value_key], value_key,\n+                        self.bulk_data_element_handler\n                     )\n                 ds.add(elem)\n         return ds\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(patch)\n```<end_code>",

It lets you read, modify and write DICOM data in an easy \"pythonic\" way.\n\nAs a pure Python package, *pydicom* can run anywhere Python runs without any other requirements, although if you're working with *Pixel Data* then we recommend you also install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\n\nIf you're looking for a Python library for DICOM networking then you might be interested in another of our projects: [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n```\npip install pydicom\n```\nUsing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge pydicom\n```\n\nFor more information, including installation instructions for the development version, see the [installation guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe *pydicom* [user guide](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/old/pydicom_user_guide.html), [tutorials](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/index.html), [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) and [API reference](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/index.html) documentation is available for both the [current release](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable) and the [development version](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) on GitHub Pages.\n\n## *Pixel Data*\n\nCompressed and uncompressed *Pixel Data* is always available to\nbe read, changed and written as [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects):\n```python\n>>> from pydicom import dcmread\n>>> from pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n>>> path = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\n>>> ds = dcmread(path)\n>>> type(ds.PixelData)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> len(ds.PixelData)\n32768\n>>> ds.PixelData[:2]\nb'\\xaf\\x00'\n\n```\n\nIf [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is installed, *Pixel Data* can be converted to an [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) using the [Dataset.pixel_array](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/reference/generated/pydicom.dataset.Dataset.html#pydicom.dataset.Dataset.pixel_array) property:\n\n```python\n>>> arr = ds.pixel_array\n>>> arr.shape\n(128, 128)\n>>> arr\narray([[175, 180, 166, ..., 203, 207, 216],\n       [186, 183, 157, ..., 181, 190, 239],\n       [184, 180, 171, ..., 152, 164, 235],\n       ...,\n       [906, 910, 923, ..., 922, 929, 927],\n       [914, 954, 938, ..., 942, 925, 905],\n       [959, 955, 916, ..., 911, 904, 909]], dtype=int16)\n```\n### Compressed *Pixel Data*\n#### JPEG, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000\nConverting JPEG compressed *Pixel Data* to an ``ndarray`` requires installing one or more additional Python libraries. For information on which libraries are required, see the [pixel data handler documentation](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/old/image_data_handlers.html#guide-compressed).\n\nCompressing data into one of the JPEG formats is not currently supported.\n\n#### RLE\nRLE encoded *Pixel Data* only requires NumPy, and compression and decompression are both supported.\n\n## Examples\nMore [examples](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/auto_examples/index.html) are available in the documentation.\n\n**Change a patient's ID**\n```python\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\n\nds = dcmread(\"/path/to/file.dcm\")\n# Edit the (0010,0020) 'Patient ID' element\nds.PatientID = \"12345678\"\nds.save_as(\"/path/to/file_updated.dcm\")\n```\n\n**Display the Pixel Data**\n\nWith [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pydicom import dcmread\nfrom pydicom.data import get_testdata_file\n\n# The path to a pydicom test dataset\npath = get_testdata_file(\"CT_small.dcm\")\nds = dcmread(path)\n# `arr` is a numpy.ndarray\narr = ds.pixel_array\n\nplt.imshow(arr, cmap=\"gray\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to *pydicom*, read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute an example or extension of *pydicom* that doesn't belong with the core software, see our contribution repository:\n[contrib-pydicom](https://www.github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom).\n\n\n\n================================================\nFile: CONTRIBUTING.md\n================================================\n\nContributing to pydicom\n=======================\n\nThis is the guide for contributing code, documentation and tests, and for\nfiling issues. Please read it carefully to help make the code review\nprocess go as smoothly as possible and maximize the likelihood of your\ncontribution being merged.\n\n_Note:_  \nIf you want to contribute new functionality, you may first consider if this \nfunctionality belongs to the pydicom core, or is better suited for\n[contrib-pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom). contrib-pydicom\ncollects some convenient functionality that uses pydicom, but doesn't\nbelong to the pydicom core. If you're not sure where your contribution belongs, \ncreate an issue where you can discuss this before creating a pull request.\n\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nThe preferred workflow for contributing to pydicom is to fork the\n[main repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) on\nGitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:\n\n1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom)\n   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates\n   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on\n   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n2. Clone your fork of the pydicom repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydicom.git\n   $ cd pydicom\n   ```\n\n3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b my-feature\n   ```\n\n   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!\n\n4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_files\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n5. Add a meaningful commit message. Pull requests are \"squash-merged\", e.g.\n   squashed into one commit with all commit messages combined. The commit\n   messages can be edited during the merge, but it helps if they are clearly\n   and briefly showing what has been done in the commit. Check out the \n   [seven commonly accepted rules](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines)\n   for commit messages. Here are some examples, taken from actual commits:\n   \n   ```\n   Add support for new VRs OV, SV, UV\n   \n   -  closes #1016\n   ```\n   ```\n   Add warning when saving compressed without encapsulation  \n   ``` \n   ```\n   Add optional handler argument to Dataset.decompress()\n   \n   - also add it to Dataset.convert_pixel_data()\n   - add separate error handling for given handle\n   - see #537\n   ```\n   \n6. To record your changes in Git, push the changes to your GitHub\n   account with:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin my-feature\n   ```\n\n7. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\nto create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.\n\n(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the\n[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)\n\nPull Request Checklist\n----------------------\n\nWe recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before you\nsubmit a pull request:\n\n-  Follow the style used in the rest of the code. That mostly means to\n   follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for\n   the code, and the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)\n   for documentation.\n   \n-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to\n   describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request\n   description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is\n   created. Use \"closes #issue-number\" or \"fixes #issue-number\" to let GitHub \n   automatically close the related issue on commit. Use any other keyword \n   (i.e. works on, related) to avoid GitHub to close the referenced issue.\n\n-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample\n   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.\n\n-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for Merge),\n   if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. Some of the\n   core developers will review your code, make suggestions for changes, and\n   approve it as soon as it is ready for merge. Pull requests are usually merged\n   after two approvals by core developers, or other developers asked to review the code. \n   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before receiving a full\n   review -- should be prefixed with `[WIP]` (to indicate a work in progress) and\n   changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to: indicate you are\n   working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of\n   functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the\n   inclusion of a\n   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   in the PR description.\n\n-  When adding additional functionality, check if it makes sense to add one or\n   more example scripts in the ``examples/`` folder. Have a look at other\n   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new\n   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it\n   to other methods available in pydicom.\n\n-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be\n   accepted. Bug-fixes shall be provided with \n   [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regression_testing) that\n   fail before the fix. For new features, the correct behavior shall be\n   verified by feature tests. A good practice to write sufficient tests is \n   [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n\nYou can also check for common programming errors and style issues with the\nfollowing tools:\n\n-  Code with good unittest **coverage** (current coverage or better), check\n with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pytest pytest-cov\n  $ py.test --cov=pydicom path/to/test_for_package\n  ```\n\n-  No pyflakes warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pyflakes\n  $ pyflakes path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  No PEP8 warnings, check with:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install pycodestyle  # formerly called pep8 \n  $ pycodestyle path/to/module.py\n  ```\n\n-  AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easy redundant errors:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ pip install autopep8\n  $ autopep8 path/to/pep8.py\n  ```\n\nFiling bugs\n-----------\nWe use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to\nopen an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.\n\nIt is recommended to check that your issue complies with the\nfollowing rules before submitting:\n\n-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other\n   [issues](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues?q=)\n   or [pull requests](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/pulls?q=).\n\n-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in\n   appropriate code blocks.\n   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well\n   as your Python and pydicom versions.\n\n   If you're using **pydicom 2 or later**, please use the `pydicom_env_info`\n   module to gather this information :\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python -m pydicom.env_info\n   ```\n\n   For **pydicom 1.x**, please run the following code snippet instead.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform, sys, pydicom\n   print(platform.platform(),\n         \"\\nPython\", sys.version,\n         \"\\npydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\n   ```\n\n-  please include a [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code\n   snippet or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is\n   raised, please provide the traceback. (use `%xmode` in ipython to use the\n   non beautified version of the trackeback)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,\nreStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc.\nreStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the\n``doc/`` directory.\n\nYou can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate\nthe HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``doc/`` directory.\nAlternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the\ndocumentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will\nbe placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the\n``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.\n\nFor building the documentation, you will need\n[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),\n[numpy](http://numpy.org/),\n[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and\n[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nWhen you are writing documentation that references DICOM, it is often\nhelpful to reference the related part of the\n[DICOM standard](https://www.dicomstandard.org/current/).

The byte stream of the `dataset` will be\n    placed into the file after the DICOM *File Meta Information*.\n\n    If `write_like_original` is ``True`` then the :class:`Dataset` will be\n    written as is (after minimal validation checking) and may or may not\n    contain all or parts of the *File Meta Information* (and hence may or\n    may not be conformant with the DICOM File Format).\n\n    **File Meta Information**\n\n    The *File Meta Information* consists of a 128-byte preamble, followed by\n    a 4 byte ``b'DICM'`` prefix, followed by the *File Meta Information Group*\n    elements.\n\n    **Preamble and Prefix**\n\n    The ``dataset.preamble`` attribute shall be 128-bytes long or ``None`` and\n    is available for use as defined by the Application Profile or specific\n    implementations. If the preamble is not used by an Application Profile or\n    specific implementation then all 128 bytes should be set to ``0x00``.

Some of these elements are required (Type 1) while\n    others are optional (Type 3/1C). If `write_like_original` is ``True``\n    then the *File Meta Information Group* elements are all optional. See\n    :func:`~pydicom.filewriter.write_file_meta_info` for more information on\n    which elements are required.\n\n    The *File Meta Information Group* elements should be included within their\n    own :class:`~pydicom.dataset.Dataset` in the ``dataset.file_meta``\n    attribute.\n\n    If (0002,0010) *Transfer Syntax UID* is included then the user must ensure\n    its value is compatible with the values for the\n    ``dataset.is_little_endian`` and ``dataset.is_implicit_VR`` attributes.\n    For example, if ``is_little_endian`` and ``is_implicit_VR`` are both\n    ``True`` then the Transfer Syntax UID must be 1.2.840.10008.1.2 *Implicit\n    VR Little Endian*. See the DICOM Standard, Part 5,\n    :dcm:`Section 10<part05/chapter_10.html>` for more information on Transfer\n    Syntaxes.\n\n    *Encoding*\n\n    The preamble and prefix are encoding independent.
