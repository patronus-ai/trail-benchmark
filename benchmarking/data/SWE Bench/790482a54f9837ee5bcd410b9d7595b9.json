This is regarded as the best default behaviour.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n>**It is strongly advised that you do not add any handlers other than NullHandler to your library\u2019s loggers.** This is because the configuration of handlers is the prerogative of the application developer who uses your library. The application developer knows their target audience and what handlers are most appropriate for their application: if you add handlers \u2018under the hood\u2019, you might well interfere with their ability to carry out unit tests and deliver logs which suit their requirements. \r\n\nI think you make good points here.  I support changing the logging to comply with python's suggested behavior.\r\n\r\n> In addition, I don't understand what the purpose of the config.debug function\r\n\r\nOne reason is that the core loop in pydicom (data_element_generator in filereader.py) is extremely optimized for speed - it checks the `debugging` flag set by config.debug, to avoid composing messages and doing function calls to logger when not needed.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\", \"stream\": false, \"reset\": true, \"images\": null, \"additional_args\": null, \"max_steps\": null}",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}], \"stop_sequences\": [\"<end_code>\", \"Observation:\", \"Calling tools:\"], \"grammar\": null, \"tools_to_call_from\": null, \"kwargs\": {}}",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file.

The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\npydicom should not define handler, formatter and log level.\\nThe `config` module (imported when pydicom is imported) defines a handler and set the log level for the pydicom logger.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

The question is in French.\\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\\\"\\n\\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\\nCode:\\n```py\\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\\\"French\\\", tgt_lang=\\\"English\\\")\\nprint(f\\\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\\\")\\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\\nfinal_answer(f\\\"The answer is {answer}\\\")\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:\\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\\n\\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npages = search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation:\\nNo result found for query \\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\\\".\\n\\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

Let's compute the result using python code.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\npydicom should not define handler, formatter and log level.\\nThe `config` module (imported when pydicom is imported) defines a handler and set the log level for the pydicom logger.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\npydicom should not define handler, formatter and log level.\\nThe `config` module (imported when pydicom is imported) defines a handler and set the log level for the pydicom logger.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\npydicom should not define handler, formatter and log level.\\nThe `config` module (imported when pydicom is imported) defines a handler and set the log level for the pydicom logger.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\npydicom should not define handler, formatter and log level.\\nThe `config` module (imported when pydicom is imported) defines a handler and set the log level for the pydicom logger.

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city} population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\"}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"New task:\\nYou will be provided with a partial code base and an issue statement explaining a problem to resolve.\\n\\n<issue>\\npydicom should not define handler, formatter and log level.\\nThe `config` module (imported when pydicom is imported) defines a handler and set the log level for the pydicom logger.

Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by generating a patch file that addresses the problem of pydicom configuring logging without allowing client code to control it.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by generating a patch file that addresses the problem of pydicom configuring logging without allowing client code to control it.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs.

He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city} population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",

DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\\n```\\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\\nimport asyncio\\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\\\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\\\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\\n```\\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n================================================\\nFile: README.md\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\\n\\n================================================\\nFile: directory/file.py\\n================================================\\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\\n...\\n```\\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\\n\\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\\n\\n```\\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile: README\\\\.md\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\\\s*\\n=(2,)\\\\s*\\nFile:|\\\\Z)'\\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(1).strip()\\n    return \\\"README.md content not found\\\"\\n```\\n\\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\\n\"}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"I'll solve this issue by generating a patch file that addresses the problem of pydicom configuring logging without allowing client code to control it.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city} population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['asyncio', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'gitingest', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'os', 'pandas', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sys', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

Please respond with a single patch file in the format shown above.\nTo solve this, you must first use gitingest as follows (you can use this as many times as you want):\n```\nfrom gitingest import ingest_async\nimport asyncio\nsummary, tree, content = asyncio.run(ingest_async(\"https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/3746878d8edf1cbda6fbcf35eec69f9ba79301ca\", max_file_size=1*1024*1024)) # filters out files greater than 1MB in size\n```\nYou must then carefully analyze the tree structure of the repository and its summary to understand the code and the directory structure.\nThe content variable is a huge string (cannot be printed or processed directly). The structure of the string is as follows:\n\n```\n================================================\nFile: README.md\n================================================\n[Contents of the README.md file here]\n\n================================================\nFile: directory/file.py\n================================================\n[Contents of the directory/file.py file here]\n...\n```\nYou must parse this string in-memory by writing the appropriate regex code to extract the contents of the required file accordingly. Do not attempt to read the full string at any cost and always write regex to parse or search the content string for suitable files and contents.\n\nA sample regex function to extract the content of the README.md, you would:\n\n```\ndef extract_readme_content(text):\n    pattern = r'=(2,)\\s*\nFile: README\\.md\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\n(.*?)(?=\\s*\n=(2,)\\s*\nFile:|\\Z)'\n    match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)    \n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return \"README.md content not found\"\n```\n\nRemember that you can read the summary and tree variables directly but do not attempt to read entire content string since it might be too large to keep in memory. You must find a suitable method to read and understand these code files.\nThere is a possibility that the content of the file (for example content of directory/file.py in the example above) might be too large to read as well so you must only read it in chunks or perform regex searches over the extracted file string. Never read the entire contents of the `content` variable or the specific content file directly.\nDO NOT try to use git commands and only use the gitingest import for reading and understanding the file system to generate a suitable patch file. DO NOT print file contents to the terminal for analysis at all costs. If you want to analyze a file string's contents, make sure to do it 500 characters at a time.\n",
