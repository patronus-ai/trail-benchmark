We need the volume (mL) occupied by 0.312\u202fkg of Freon\u201112 when it is in its liquid state under the extreme pressure at the bottom of the Marianas Trench and equilibrated at that location\u2019s \u201cpeak temperature.\u201d In outline we must: \n\n1. Identify the conditions at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. The depth is about 11\u202fkm so the hydrostatic pressure is roughly 1100 atmospheres (\u2248110\u202fMPa). Deep-ocean temperatures are nearly constant; the \u201cpeak\u201d temperature at the bottom is typically between 1 and 4 \u00b0C. For our estimation we assume roughly 2 \u00b0C. \n2. At \u201cnormal\u201d conditions, liquid Freon\u201112 (dichlorodifluoromethane) has a density near 1.2\u202fg/cm\u00b3. When subjected to high pressure the liquid is slightly compressed. Liquids are only modestly compressible. Many organic liquids have a bulk modulus of order 1\u202fGPa or higher. Using the linear compressibility approximation: \n\u2003\u2003\u0394V/V \u2248 \u2013\u0394P/K. \nFor \u0394P \u2248 110 MPa and assuming K \u2248 1\u202fGPa, the fractional change in volume is about 0.11 (or 11% reduction). This leads to a corresponding increase in density by about 1/(1 \u2212 0.11) \u2248 1.12. Therefore, our \u201chigh-pressure\u201d density estimate becomes: \n\u2003\u2003density \u2248 1.2\u202fg/cm\u00b3 \u00d7 1.12 \u2248 1.34\u202fg/cm\u00b3. \n3. The volume V (in cm\u00b3) is given by mass/density. Converting 0.312\u202fkg to grams gives 312\u202fg. Then \n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 312 g \u00f7 1.34 g/cm\u00b3 \u2248 232.8 cm\u00b3. \nSince 1 cm\u00b3 = 1 mL, this is about 233 mL. Rounding to the nearest mL yields 233 mL. \n\nThere is some uncertainty in the exact values (the density under these conditions might be slightly higher or lower), but using reasonable estimation parameters (deep-water temperature \u22482 \u00b0C, pressure \u2248110 MPa, ambient Freon\u201112 density \u22481.2\u202fg/cm\u00b3, and K \u22481 GPa) the computed value is about 233 mL. \n\nI now provide the final answer as just an integer.",

Verify the phase of Freon\u201112 to ensure the correct density is used for calculations (confirm whether it is in the liquid state under these conditions). \n4. Calculate the volume using the formula Volume = Mass / Density, ensuring the units are consistent (e.g., if density is in kg/m\u00b3, adjust accordingly). \n5.
