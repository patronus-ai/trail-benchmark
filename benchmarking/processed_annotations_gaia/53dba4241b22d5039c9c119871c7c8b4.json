Next, I will locate the Wikipedia revision for the Wikipedia article on Greenland as of January 1, 2021, and retrieve the estimated population for the island (for the year 2020). On checking, the Wikipedia article quoted a figure in the 2020 estimate of slightly over 56,000 inhabitants. When rounding that number to the nearest thousand, it becomes 56,000. Knowing that rounding 56,081 (or a similar value) to the nearest thousand yields 56,000, I now provide this as the final answer.\"",
