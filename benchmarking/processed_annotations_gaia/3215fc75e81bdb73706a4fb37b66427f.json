Its plan involved retrieving the file, reading its contents with `inspect_file_as_text`, and then searching/extracting the value from the text. Instead, after performing the web search, it directly extracted the required information from the search result snippet (Span 7) and called `final_answer`, bypassing the intended file inspection steps.",
