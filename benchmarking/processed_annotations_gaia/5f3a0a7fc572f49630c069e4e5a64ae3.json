The system misused the page_down tool several times with invalid input formats, indicating a lack of robustness in handling simple tool constraints. These errors were not isolated but spread across multiple shards, causing unnecessary delays and signaling inefficient error recovery. Although the final output was accurate, the process leading there revealed limitations in input validation and reasoning consistency, which impacted overall reliability.",

The missing tag resulted in a slight deviation from the specified guidelines, affecting the overall adherence. Despite this issue, the rest of the instructions were followed thoroughly, but the absence of this key detail led to a deduction in the score.",

The plan showed persistence, effective tool chaining, and logical progression, gradually narrowing down relevant information and verifying the answer.
