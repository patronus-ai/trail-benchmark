It doesn't propose a significantly different approach, such as finding ridership data and timetable data separately and trying to cross-reference them, or using the `find_archived_url` tool more strategically to find a relevant 2019 schedule first.",

It admits that no official public document *unambiguously links* this information but claims \"indirect\" evidence and a \"most consistent interpretation\" from \"snippets\" and \"recurring times\" in general reports/timetables.
