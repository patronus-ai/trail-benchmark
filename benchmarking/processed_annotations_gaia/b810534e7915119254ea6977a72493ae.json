Verify that this ID (or an appropriately adjusted version with leading zeros if needed) is a 9-digit number suitable for the ISBN-10 check digit computation.\n3. Review the ISBN-10 check digit algorithm: multiply each digit by its respective weight (from 10 to 2), sum the products, then calculate the modulus 11 of this sum, and derive the check digit (using \u201cX\u201d for a result of 10).\n4. Apply the ISBN-10 algorithm to the 9-digit Tropicos ID: compute the weighted sum, determine the modulus, and calculate the appropriate check digit.\n5.
