With this strategy, his worst-case (guaranteed) win is 10 coins, which, when multiplied by $1,000 per coin, amounts to $10,000.",

According to the system, the code results in 496 valid distributions, an optimal guess of (10, 10, 10), and a maximum worst-case win of 10 coins, leading to a guaranteed win of $10,000. However, when the code is actually run in a compiler, it produces a different result: 66 valid distributions, an optimal guess of (6, 6, 6), and a maximum worst-case win of 12 coins, meaning Bob can guarantee at least $12,000. This discrepancy shows that the system's summary and output are not based on the actual behavior of the code and instead present fabricated values, potentially misleading the reader about the program's true results.",
