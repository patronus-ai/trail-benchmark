The task clearly outlined that the '\\n<end_plan>' tag should be included at the end of the output, but this requirement was not fulfilled. The missing tag resulted in a slight deviation from the specified guidelines, affecting the overall adherence. Despite this issue, the rest of the instructions were followed thoroughly, but the absence of this key detail led to a deduction in the score.",

The chosen approach\u2014prioritizing later balls due to the platform's shifting behavior\u2014is the most efficient and theoretically sound method to maximize winning odds, leaving no better alternative unexplored. The runtime issue in Shard 4 is an execution flaw, not a planning flaw, so the optimality of the plan itself remains uncompromised.",
