            "description": "The error encountered is ultimately a formatting issue, specifically related to how the file is being read. Although the tool claims to support .mp3 files, its internal implementation attempts to open the file in text mode (\"rt\" with UTF-8 encoding), which is only suitable for text-based formats. Since .mp3 is a binary audio file, this results in a failure when the system tries to interpret its contents as text. Therefore, while the file may exist and be correctly referenced, the real problem lies in the mismatch between the file type and the method used to read it. To handle .mp3 files properly, the tool should either employ audio transcription capabilities or read the file in binary mode before passing it to a transcription module. This highlights a discrepancy between the tool's advertised functionality and its actual implementation.",
