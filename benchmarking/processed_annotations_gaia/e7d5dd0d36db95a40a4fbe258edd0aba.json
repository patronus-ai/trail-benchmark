Specifically, there was a fundamental misunderstanding of how certain tools function\u2014such as attempting to use search_agent for data extraction rather than search, and incorrectly calling page_down with invalid parameters. These misapplications led to inefficiencies and preventable tool execution errors, which could have compromised the reliability of the outcome had the system not managed to recover.
