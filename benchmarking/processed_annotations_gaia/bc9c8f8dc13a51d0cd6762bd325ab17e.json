In addition, the system abused the search_agent tool; the `web_search` tool was called repeatedly without properly comprehending the tool's input parameters, leading to resource and time wastage.",

The task clearly outlined that the '\\n<end_plan>' tag should be included at the end of the output, but this requirement was not fulfilled. The missing tag resulted in a slight deviation from the specified guidelines, affecting the overall adherence. Despite this issue, the rest of the instructions were followed thoroughly, but the absence of this key detail led to a deduction in the score.",

The model broke down the task into logical steps, identified the key elements of the question such as the James Beard Award winners, Ali Khan, the TV show starting in 2015, and the New Mexican staple, and then connected these elements through targeted research and verification. It maintained focus on the core objective and adapted its strategy where necessary, ultimately arriving at the correct answer.",
