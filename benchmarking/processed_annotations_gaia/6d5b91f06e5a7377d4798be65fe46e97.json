Identify the individual cuneiform symbols: separate the two groups \"\ud809\udc1c\" and \"\ud809\udc10\ud809\udc1a\" and note each unique sign. \n2. Research and determine the numeric values corresponding to each of the identified cuneiform symbols using scholarly sources or accepted Unicode/cuneiform sign lists. \n3. Review the rules of the Babylonian numeral system\u2014confirm how digits are combined in groups and determine positional significance (i.e., which group represents the higher-order value and which the lower). \n4. Map each symbol (or group of symbols) to its numeric value and, if a group contains multiple signs, compute the additive digit value according to Babylonian numeral conventions. \n5. Use the base\u201160 positional system to calculate the overall value: multiply the higher-order group's value by 60 and add the lower-order value. \n6. Verify the calculation by cross-checking with known examples or additional trusted sources. \n7. Report the final decimal (Arabic numeral) number as the answer. \n\n\n``` \nOutput: \nThinking through the problem, we must \u201cread\u201d the ancient numeral correctly.
