Although the tool claims to support .pdb files, its internal implementation attempts to open the file in text mode (\"rt\" with UTF-8 encoding), which is only suitable for text-based formats. Since the file is .pdb, this results in a failure when the system tries to interpret its contents as text. Therefore, while the file may exist and be correctly referenced, the real problem lies in the mismatch between the file type and the method used to read it.",
